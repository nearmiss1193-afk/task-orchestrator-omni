Subject: Re: Your interest in Google Cloud

Hi Michael,

Thanks for reaching out. We are definitely interested in exploring what Google Cloud can offer as we scale our operations.

Here are the details you requested:

1. Project Scope & Use Case
Primary Goal:
We are building "Empire Unified," a fully autonomous AI Agency Operating System. The system orchestrates thousands of AI agents to handle end-to-end business logic.

**Flagship Product: Veo Visionary**
We are also actively developing (in Google AI Studio) a commercial-grade, standalone video generation suite called "Veo Visionary". utilizing the new `@google/genai` SDK and Veo models. This tool allows users to generate, script, and edit marketing assets using a multi-agent "Creative Director" workflow. We plan to launch this as a SaaS product on GCP.

Current Infrastructure:
We currently utilize a hybrid serverless architecture (Modal.com, Supabase, Vercel). We are looking to leverage GCP for:
- Vertex AI (Gemini Pro/Flash models) for high-throughput reasoning.
- Cloud Run for containerized agent hosting.
- BigQuery for analyzing millions of interaction logs.

Interested Products:
Vertex AI, Cloud Run, Cloud SQL, BigQuery, and "Gemini for Google Workspace".

2. Budget & Timeline
Anticipated Annual Spend:
We estimate starting in the $30,000 – $50,000 range as we ramp up production traffic this quarter, with significant scaling expected in Q3/Q4.

Timeline:
Immediate. We are in the "Pre-Launch" phase and actively deploying our production environment now (1-3 months).

3. Decision & Organization
Decision-Making Authority: Yes, I am the primary decision-maker.
Stakeholders: CTO / Lead Architect (myself).
Company Headcount: 1-10 (High-leverage AI-native team).

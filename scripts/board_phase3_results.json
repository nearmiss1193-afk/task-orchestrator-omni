Switch from webhook to GHL API direct send.**  \nThis approach provides the best tracking with minimal complexity by leveraging GHL\u2019s built-in features. It allows you to receive event webhooks for opens, clicks, and bounces, thus meeting the owner's requirement for comprehensive tracking.\n\n**Data Storage and Reporting:**\n- Store tracking data in Supabase with a schema that includes fields for `contact_id`, `event_type` (open, click, bounce), `timestamp`, and `email_id`.\n- Use a reporting dashboard (e.g., Metabase or Google Data Studio) connected to Supabase to visualize the metrics.\n\n### 2. EMAIL CONVERSION FIX (0.16% \u2192 5%+):\n**Action Plan:**\n1. **Personalization:** Implement dynamic email templates that include `company_name`, `website_url`, and `niche`. Use the ai_strategy field to tailor the email body based on the lead's profile.\n2. **Subject Line A/B Testing:**  \n   - Test subject lines like \"Quick question about [company_name]\" vs. \"Is [specific service/niche] helping you?\".\n   - Use tools like Google Optimize or GHL\u2019s built-in A/B testing features to determine the most effective subject lines.\n3. **Follow-Up Sequences:**  \n   - Implement a follow-up email strategy:\n     - Day 1: Send the initial personalized email.\n     - Day 3: Reminder email with a different subject line.\n     - Day 7: Final follow-up with a special offer or value proposition.\n4. **Email Format:**  \n   - Experiment with a bfisher-style format that includes a clear value proposition upfront, making it less generic and more engaging.\n\n### 3. SCRAPED_ LEADS \u2192 REAL GHL CONTACTS:\n**Recommendation: A. Use GHL Contacts API to CREATE real contacts for each SCRAPED_ lead (bulk).**  \nThis method allows for streamlined integration with existing workflows and ensures that all leads are treated uniformly within the GHL ecosystem.\n\n**Implementation Steps:**\n1. Identify all SCRAPED_ leads and extract their relevant information (e.g., first name, email).\n2. Write a script to batch process these leads and use the GHL Contacts API (`POST /contacts`) to create real contacts in bulk.\n3. Consider scheduling this process to run periodically or setting up a trigger within your system to create new GHL contacts as soon as a lead is scraped.\n\nBy implementing these recommendations, you can significantly enhance tracking capabilities, improve email conversion rates, and ensure all leads are valid contacts within your CRM.",

EMAIL/SMS TRACKING INFRASTRUCTURE\n**RECOMMENDATION: Option D - Switch to Resend API**\n\n**Rationale:**\n- Resend is already in your stack (zero new dependencies)\n- Built-in webhooks for opens, clicks, bounces, delivery\n- Full control over tracking data without GHL limitations\n- Clean separation: GHL for contact management, Resend for email delivery\n\n**Implementation:**\n```python\n# Replace GHL webhook with Resend API\nresend.emails.send({\n    \"from\": \"your-domain@company.com\",\n    \"to\": lead.email,\n    \"subject\": personalized_subject,\n    \"html\": personalized_body,\n    \"tags\": [{\"name\": \"campaign_id\", \"value\": f\"lead_{lead.id}\"}]\n})\n```\n\n**Data Storage (Supabase):**\n```sql\nCREATE TABLE email_tracking (\n    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,\n    contact_id UUID REFERENCES contacts_master(id),\n    event_type TEXT, -- sent, delivered, opened, clicked, bounced\n    timestamp TIMESTAMP,\n    metadata JSONB\n);\n```\n\n### 2. EMAIL CONVERSION FIX (0.16% \u2192 5%+)\n**RECOMMENDATION: Multi-pronged personalization + sequence strategy**\n\n**A. Immediate Fixes:**\n- **Subject Lines (A/B test these 4):**\n  - `\"Quick {company_name} website question\"`\n  - `\"Noticed something on {website_url}\"`\n  - `\"5-min question about {niche} strategy\"`\n  - `\"This caught my eye on your site\"`\n\n**B. Body Personalization Logic:**\n```python\ndef generate_email_body(lead):\n    if lead.ai_strategy:\n        return lead.ai_strategy  # Keep AI-generated\n    else:\n        # Smart fallback using available data\n        return f\"\"\"Hi {lead.first_name},\n\nI was reviewing {lead.company_name}'s website and noticed you're doing great work in {lead.niche}.\n\nQuick question: Are you currently looking to [specific benefit related to niche]?\n\nWorth a brief chat?\n\nBest,\n[Your name]\"\"\"\n```\n\n**C. 3-Email Sequence:**\n- Day 1: Personalized question (above)\n- Day 4: Value-add follow-up with specific insight about their industry\n- Day 8: Final soft close with case study\n\n### 3. SCRAPED_ LEADS \u2192 REAL GHL CONTACTS\n**RECOMMENDATION: Option C - Automated Sync Pipeline**\n\n**Why:** Future-proof solution that prevents this problem from recurring.\n\n**Implementation Plan:**\n```python\nimport requests\n\ndef create_real_ghl_contact(lead):\n    \"\"\"Convert SCRAPED_ lead to real GHL contact\"\"\"\n    \n    payload = {\n        \"firstName\": lead.first_name,\n        \"email\": lead.email,\n        \"phone\": lead.phone,\n        \"companyName\": lead.company_name,\n        \"website\": lead.website_url,\n        \"tags\": [lead.niche, \"auto-synced\"]\n    }\n    \n    response = requests.post(\n        f\"https://rest.gohighlevel.com/v1/contacts/\",\n        headers={\"Authorization\": f\"Bearer {GHL_API_KEY}\"},\n        json=payload\n    )\n    \n    if response.status_code == 201:\n        real_ghl_id = response.json()[\"contact\"][\"id\"]\n        # Update contacts_master with real GHL ID\n        update_lead_ghl_id(lead.id, real_ghl_id)\n        return real_ghl_id\n    \n    return None\n```\n\n**Execution Plan:**\n1. **Week 1:** Bulk convert existing 444 SCRAPED_ leads using above function\n2. **Week 2:** Modify scraping pipeline to auto-create GHL contacts immediately\n3. **Week 3:** Implement fallback: if GHL creation fails, flag for Resend/Twilio direct send\n\n## IMMEDIATE ACTION ITEMS:\n1. **Day 1:** Set up Resend webh"

1. **What's still broken?**  
   - Some phone numbers (e.g., +18636928474, +18633373601, +18633373705) still point to the old "empire-inbound-vapi-webhook" endpoint, potentially causing inconsistent call routing or notifications. Additionally, user name handling in VAPI debug logs remains outdated (e.g., addressing as "Michael"), suggesting incomplete memory updates or persistence issues.

2. **Are phone number serverUrls the remaining issue for call notifications?**  
   - Yes, likely. Calls using the correct assistant ID (e.g., 1a797f12-e2dd-4f7f-b2c5-08c38c74859a) work for logging, but numbers tied to the old endpoint may fail to trigger the webhook, leading to dropped or unnotified interactions.

3. **Why might Dan still experience problems?**  
   - If Dan is calling from an affected phone number, the old endpoint could prevent full webhook integration, causing calls to end prematurely. Residual bugs in customer memory (e.g., outdated names) might also frustrate interactions despite voice logging improvements.

4. **What should we fix next?**  
   - Update serverUrls for the three problematic phone numbers to match the fixed endpoint (e.g., https://nearmiss1193-afk--ghl-omni-automation-vapi-webhook.modal.run). Then, verify and clear any stale data in VAPI debug logs and customer memory to ensure accurate name recognition. Test with a live call. (142 words)

1. **What is STILL broken right now?**  
   The assistant is still incorrectly addressing Dan as "Michael" in SMS interactions, which indicates that the name correction did not propagate correctly to all contexts. Additionally, there are lingering issues with some phone numbers pointing to outdated endpoints.

2. **Are the phone number serverUrls the remaining issue for call notifications?**  
   Yes, the phone numbers (8636928474, 8633373601, 8633373705) still point to the old "empire-inbound-vapi-webhook" endpoint, which could lead to missed notifications or failures in processing incoming calls.

3. **Why might Dan still experience problems even though voice logging works?**  
   Dan may still experience issues due to inconsistent name recognition across different interaction types (SMS vs. voice) and potential confusion from the assistant's responses. This inconsistency can lead to a lack of trust in the assistant's capabilities.

4. **What should we fix next? Be SPECIFIC.**  
   Update the server URLs for the affected phone numbers (8636928474, 8633373601, 8633373705) to point to the verified webhook endpoint. Additionally, ensure that the name correction for Dan is consistently applied across all interaction types to prevent further misidentification. Implement a test to verify that the assistant correctly retains and uses the updated name in all future interactions.

Here's my analysis of the remaining issues:

1.  **Still Broken:** The primary issue is incorrect name association. Despite the correction to "Daniel" in SMS, the VAPI debug logs consistently show "Michael" for phone number +13529368152. This indicates the system isn't properly updating the contact name in the VAPI layer. The initial SMS messages also incorrectly identified the user as "Michael" even after the fixes were deployed.

2.  **Phone Number ServerUrls:** Yes, the outdated `empire-inbound-vapi-webhook` URLs for three phone numbers are likely preventing call notifications from reaching the correct endpoint for those numbers. This is a critical issue to resolve.

3.  **Why Dan Still Has Problems:** Even with voice logging working, Dan likely experiences problems because the system incorrectly identifies him as "Michael" in the VAPI layer. This could lead to incorrect personalization, data association, and potentially routing issues.

4.  **Next Fixes:**
    *   **Update Phone Number ServerUrls:** Immediately update the server URLs for phone numbers +18636928474, +18633373601, and +18633373705 to the correct `ghl-omni-automation-vapi-webhook` endpoint.
    *   **Investigate VAPI Name Update:** Investigate why the VAPI layer isn't updating the contact name to "Daniel" for phone number +13529368152. Ensure the system correctly propagates name changes from SMS interactions to the VAPI layer.

==================================================
From direct data analysis:
1. STILL BROKEN: 3 phone numbers (8636928474, 8633373601, 8633373705) have phone-level serverUrl pointing to DEAD 'empire-inbound' endpoint. Phone-level URL can override assistant-level per Vapi docs.
2. WORKING: Voice webhook IS firing (call at 20:40 logged). SMS name fix works for messages after deploy.
3. DAN EXPERIENCE: If Dan called from a number routed through one of those 3 phones, the phone-level serverUrl sent the webhook to the dead endpoint.
4. FIX: Update serverUrl on all 3 phone numbers to our current webhook URL.

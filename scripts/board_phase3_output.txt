### 1. EMAIL/SMS TRACKING INFRASTRUCTURE:
**Recommendation: B. Switch from webhook to GHL API direct send.**  
This approach provides the best tracking with minimal complexity by leveraging GHL’s built-in features. It allows you to receive event webhooks for opens, clicks, and bounces, thus meeting the owner's requirement for comprehensive tracking.

**Data Storage and Reporting:**
- Store tracking data in Supabase with a schema that includes fields for `contact_id`, `event_type` (open, click, bounce), `timestamp`, and `email_id`.
- Use a reporting dashboard (e.g., Metabase or Google Data Studio) connected to Supabase to visualize the metrics.

### 2. EMAIL CONVERSION FIX (0.16% → 5%+):
**Action Plan:**
1. **Personalization:** Implement dynamic email templates that include `company_name`, `website_url`, and `niche`. Use the ai_strategy field to tailor the email body based on the lead's profile.
2. **Subject Line A/B Testing:**  
   - Test subject lines like "Quick question about [company_name]" vs. "Is [specific service/niche] helping you?".
   - Use tools like Google Optimize or GHL’s built-in A/B testing features to determine the most effective subject lines.
3. **Follow-Up Sequences:**  
   - Implement a follow-up email strategy:
     - Day 1: Send the initial personalized email.
     - Day 3: Reminder email with a different subject line.
     - Day 7: Final follow-up with a special offer or value proposition.
4. **Email Format:**  
   - Experiment with a bfisher-style format that includes a clear value proposition upfront, making it less generic and more engaging.

### 3. SCRAPED_ LEADS → REAL GHL CONTACTS:
**Recommendation: A. Use GHL Contacts API to CREATE real contacts for each SCRAPED_ lead (bulk).**  
This method allows for streamlined integration with existing workflows and ensures that all leads are treated uniformly within the GHL ecosystem.

**Implementation Steps:**
1. Identify all SCRAPED_ leads and extract their relevant information (e.g., first name

## BOARD BRIEF RECOMMENDATIONS - Phase 3: Revenue Optimization

### 1. EMAIL/SMS TRACKING INFRASTRUCTURE
**RECOMMENDATION: Option D - Switch to Resend API**

**Rationale:**
- Resend is already in your stack (zero new dependencies)
- Built-in webhooks for opens, clicks, bounces, delivery
- Full control over tracking data without GHL limitations
- Clean separation: GHL for contact management, Resend for email delivery

**Implementation:**
```python
# Replace GHL webhook with Resend API
resend.emails.send({
    "from": "your-domain@company.com",
    "to": lead.email,
    "subject": personalized_subject,
    "html": personalized_body,
    "tags": [{"name": "campaign_id", "value": f"lead_{lead.id}"}]
})
```

**Data Storage (Supabase):**
```sql
CREATE TABLE email_tracking (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    contact_id UUID REFERENCES contacts_master(id),
    event_type TEXT, -- sent, delivered, opened, clicked, bounced
    timestamp TIMESTAMP,
    metadata JSONB
);
```

### 2. EMAIL CONVERSION FIX (0.16% → 5%+)
**RECOMMENDATION: Multi-pronged personalization + sequence strategy**

**A. Immediate Fixes:**
- **Subject Lines (A/B test these 4):**
  - `"Quick {company_name} website question"`
  - `"Noticed something on {website_url}"`
  - `"5-min question about {niche} strategy"`
  - `"This caught my eye on your site"`

**B. Body Personalization Logic:**
```python
def generate_email_body(lead):
    if lead.ai_strategy:
        return lead.ai_strategy  # Keep AI-generated
    else:
        # Smart fallback using available data
        return f"""Hi {lead.first_name},

I was reviewing {lead.company_name}'s website and noticed you're doing great work in {lead.niche}.

Quick question: Are you currently looking to [specific benefit related to niche]?

Worth a brief chat?

Best,
[Your name]"""
```

**C. 3-Email Sequence:**
- Day 1: Personalized question (above)
- Day 4: Value-add follow-up with specific insight about their industry
- Day 8: Final soft close with case study

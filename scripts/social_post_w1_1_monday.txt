⚠️ Florida business owners — did you know?

The Florida Digital Bill of Rights (FDBR) went into effect in 2024. If your website collects ANY personal data (contact forms, cookies, analytics), you may need to comply.

Non-compliance can result in fines up to $50,000 per violation.

3 things to check RIGHT NOW:
1️⃣ Do you have a clear Privacy Policy linked on every page?
2️⃣ Do you have a cookie consent banner?
3️⃣ Can users request deletion of their data?

Most small business websites fail ALL THREE. 😬

We run free compliance scans — comment "CHECK" to get yours.

ERROR: {"message":["each value in serverMessages must be one of the following values: assistant.started, conversation-update, end-of-call-report, function-call, hang, language-changed, language-change-detect

=== STEP 2: Update Sarah's Phone Number ===

=== STEP 3: Verify Config ===
Name: Sarah Spart#
serverUrl: None
serverMessages: None
Phone: +19362984339
Phone serverUrl: https://nearmiss1193-afk--ghl-omni-automation-vapi-webhook.modal.run

=== DONE ===
Sarah's assistant now has:
  serverUrl -> https://nearmiss1193-afk--ghl-omni-automation-vapi-webhook.modal.run
  serverMessages -> includes end-of-call-report
This means Vapi will now POST to our Modal webhook when calls end.
Our vapi_webhook handler in deploy.py will process it.
PLUS the heartbeat polling will catch any missed calls as backup.

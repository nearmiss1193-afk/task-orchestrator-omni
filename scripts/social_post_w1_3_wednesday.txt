==================================================

💰 Slow websites lose 7% in conversions for every 1-second delay.

I just audited 50 pest control company websites in Florida. The average load time? 6.8 seconds. 🐌

Google's benchmark: Under 2.5 seconds.

That means most local businesses are losing over 30% of potential customers before they even see the homepage.

Quick wins to speed up your site:
🔧 Compress images (use WebP format)
🔧 Enable browser caching
🔧 Minimize JavaScript
🔧 Use a CDN

Home service businesses spend an average of $150-300 per lead on Angi/HomeAdvisor.

But did you know your own website could generate leads for $0?

Here's the math:
💸 20 leads/month x $200/lead = $4,000/month on directories
🏠 Website generating 20 leads/month = $0/month (after setup)

The catch? Your website needs to actually WORK.

That means:
→ Fast loading (under 2.5 seconds)
→ Mobile optimized
→ SEO-friendly
→ Clear calls to action
→ AI-visible

One-time investment vs. monthly bleeding.

Which sounds better?

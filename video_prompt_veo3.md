```markdown
Create a 60-second cinematic commercial for an AI phone answering service targeting HVAC companies.

STYLE: Modern, professional, slight dramatic tension. Dark color palette with blue accent lighting. Clean typography overlays.

SCENE 1 (0-8 seconds):
Nighttime exterior of a suburban Florida home. It's 2 AM (show digital clock). Inside, a family is sweating - the AC has broken. The father grabs his phone and calls an HVAC company.
Text overlay: "Florida. 2 AM. 97°F inside."

SCENE 2 (8-15 seconds):
Close-up of a business phone ringing in an empty, dark HVAC office. No one answers. Cut to voicemail picking up: "You've reached [Company], leave a message..."
The frustrated homeowner hangs up.
Text overlay: "Your customer needs you. But you're asleep."

SCENE 3 (15-25 seconds):
Same scenario, different outcome. Phone rings - but this time a friendly AI voice answers immediately: "Thanks for calling! I understand your AC is out - that's miserable in this heat. Let me get your information and schedule a tech first thing in the morning."
Text overlay: "What if you never missed another call?"

SCENE 4 (25-40 seconds):
Split screen showing:
- Left: The relieved homeowner, now hopeful
- Right: The HVAC owner peacefully sleeping
The AI voice continues: "I've got you scheduled for 7 AM. You'll get a text confirmation shortly. Is there anything else I can help with?"
Text overlay: "Lead captured. Appointment booked. You never woke up."

SCENE 5 (40-55 seconds):
Morning. HVAC tech arrives at the home, customer greets them warmly. Cut to HVAC business owner checking phone - sees notification: "New booking: Emergency AC repair - $450 job"
Text overlay: "Turn missed calls into money. 24/7."

SCENE 6 (55-60 seconds):
Logo animation: "AI Service Co" with tagline "Never Miss Another Lead"
Call to action: "Book Your Free Demo: aiserviceco.com"
Blue gradient background, professional finish.

AUDIO: Subtle dramatic music building to hopeful resolution. AI voice should sound warm, professional, and human-like (female voice preferred).

MOOD: Problem → Solution → Relief → Success

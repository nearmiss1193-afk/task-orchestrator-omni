    "raw": "Okay, here's a breakdown of potential causes and actions for the branding issue, followed by dramatic capability descriptions for your commercial:\n\n## Response to Question 1: Branding Change Investigation\n\nThis is a critical issue. We need to address it immediately. Here's a breakdown of potential causes and the necessary actions:\n\n**Why this might have happened:**\n\n*   **Recent Deployment Overwrite:** **Highly Likely**. Deployments are often the source of unexpected changes. Even small code pushes can inadvertently impact seemingly unrelated areas. A misconfigured deployment script, incorrect environment variable, or overlooked configuration file change could easily overwrite the branding.\n*   **Configuration File Change:** **Possible**. A centrally managed configuration file (e.g., a JSON, YAML, or environment variable file) could have been altered, either directly or through an automated process. This is especially likely if the branding is stored as a variable in a system-wide configuration.\n*   **Intentional Rebranding:** **Possible, but unlikely without explicit communication**. A complete rebranding is a significant undertaking. If this was intentional, there should have been internal communication and documentation. The lack of awareness strongly suggests it's *not* intentional. *However, we can't completely rule this out until we confirm with stakeholders.*\n*   **Accidental Rebranding:** **Possible**. Someone may have unintentionally changed the branding settings while testing or working on another feature.\n*   **Security Breach/Compromise:** **Less Likely, but MUST be investigated**. Although less likely than the other options, a security breach could allow unauthorized individuals to make such changes.\n\n**What we should do about it:**\n\n1.  **IMMEDIATE ACTION: Isolate and Preserve the Current State.** Do not make any changes to the website immediately. Instead:\n\n    *   Take a snapshot of the current system configuration (database, files, and deployment history) for forensic analysis.\n    *   Contact the relevant teams (Development, Marketing, and IT Security) to alert them to the situation.\n\n2.  **URGENT Investigation:**\n\n    *   **Check Recent Deployments:** Review the deployment history for any deployments that occurred around the time the branding changed. Examine the change logs of those deployments to identify any files or configurations that might have affected the branding.\n    *   **Review Configuration Files:** Inspect the configuration files used by the website to determine if any changes have been made to the branding settings. Look for files related to themes, templates, or general site settings.\n    *   **Communicate with Stakeholders:** Contact the Marketing and Executive teams to determine if a rebranding effort is underway that wasn't properly communicated. This is the MOST important step in understanding the intent behind this change.\n    *   **Check Security Logs:** Review server logs and security logs for any suspicious activity that might indicate a security breach.\n\n3.  **Based on the Investigation:**\n\n    *   **If Accidental:** Immediately revert the branding back to \"AI Service Co\" using the appropriate deployment or configuration management tools. Then, implement measures to prevent accidental branding changes in the future (e.g., stricter deployment procedures, improved access controls).\n    *   **If Intentional and Approved:** Gather all necessary documentation (branding guidelines, updated logos, etc.) and ensure the website is fully aligned with the new brand. Communicate the change to customers and stakeholders.\n    *   **If Intentional but Unauthorized:** Escalate the issue to management for further investigation and disciplinary action. Revert the branding and implement stronger security measures to prevent future unauthorized changes.\n    *   **If Security Breach:** Immediately implement your security incident response plan. Isolate the affected systems, conduct a thorough security audit, and take steps to prevent future breaches.\n\n4.  **Root Cause Analysis:** Once the immediate issue is resolved, conduct a root cause analysis to determine why the branding change occurred in the first place. This will help prevent similar incidents in the future.\n\n## Response to Question 2: Capabilities List for Commercial\n\nHere's a dramatically written list of your capabilities, perfect for a cinematic commercial script:\n\n**Commercial Capabilities List**\n\n**1.

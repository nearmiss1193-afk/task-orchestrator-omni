MODE SWITCHING STRATEGY\n**Recommendations:**\n- **Detection of Call Type (Inbound vs Outbound):**\n  - Utilize Vapi\u2019s metadata or call initiation parameters to tag calls as inbound or outbound at the start. For instance, inbound calls via the website widget can be flagged with a specific source ID or parameter (e.g., `call_type: \"inbound\"`), while outbound calls from the database can be tagged as `call_type: \"outbound\"`.\n  - If"

    "raw": "## BOARD PROTOCOL: Sarah AI Intelligent Mode Switching Strategy - Recommendations\n\nHere are focused, actionable recommendations for improving Sarah AI's performance, addressing the outlined questions, and a recommendation on whether to build this feature.\n\n**1. MODE SWITCHING STRATEGY**:\n\n*   **Detection:**\n    *   **Inbound:** Leverage the Vapi widget context. Incoming calls from the widget should be automatically tagged as \"inbound.\" Pass the widget URL as metadata to Sarah.\n    *   **Outbound:** Any calls initiated *through* the outbound calling system should be tagged as \"outbound\" at initiation.\n    *   **Fallback:** If no tag exists (unlikely but possible), use a brief initial greeting question. Inbound: \"Thank you for calling, how can I help you today?\" Outbound: \"Hello, this is Sarah from [Company Name], am I speaking with [Prospect Name]?\" Analyze the response for keywords (\"help,\" \"calling\" = inbound; \"yes,\" \"speaking\" = outbound). This is a last resort.\n\n*   **Scripts/Personas:** **YES.** Different scripts and personas are crucial.\n    *   **Inbound:** Focus on helpfulness, problem-solving, and guiding the customer.  A more empathetic and understanding tone. Script should include clear steps to answer common questions and escalate complex issues.\n    *   **Outbound:** Focus on brevity, value proposition, and scheduling a follow-up.  More assertive, highlighting key benefits, overcoming objections.\n\n*   **Seamless Switching:**\n    *   **Clear Mode Indicator:** Program Sarah to verbally state her purpose immediately. \"Thank you for calling [Company Name], this is Sarah, how can I help you today?\" (inbound) OR \"Hello [Prospect Name], this is Sarah from [Company Name], calling to see if you're available for a quick chat about...\" (outbound).\n    *   **Pre-loaded Context:** Each mode should load relevant context (customer information for inbound, prospect information for outbound) from the database *before* the call begins. This informs the initial greeting and subsequent interaction.\n    *   **Dynamic Adjustment:** During the call, use Natural Language Understanding (NLU) to adjust responses.  For example, if an outbound call turns into a technical support question, Sarah should acknowledge the shift and transition to a helpful tone.\n\n**2. CUSTOMER NOTIFICATION SYSTEM**:\n\n*   **High-Value Detection:**\n    *   **Sentiment Analysis:** Implement sentiment analysis to gauge the caller's emotional state and interest level. Positive sentiment and expressions of need are key.\n    *   **Keyword Triggers:** Identify keywords related to purchase intent (e.g., \"pricing,\" \"demo,\" \"buy,\" \"sign up,\" \"contract\").\n    *   **Engagement Metrics:** Track metrics like conversation length, number of questions asked, and positive responses to offers.\n    *   **Question types:** Is the user asking \"how does it work?\" or \"how do I get started?\".\n\n*   **Signals of Purchase Readiness:**\n    *   Asking about pricing and packages.\n    *   Expressing a clear need or pain point that your product solves.\n    *   Requesting a demo or a trial period.\n    *   Inquiring about contracts or agreements.\n    *   Using positive and enthusiastic language.\n\n*   **Real-time Notification:**\n    *   **SMS:** For urgent leads (high purchase intent, expressing urgency).  Format: \"HIGH VALUE LEAD! [Customer Name/Phone Number] is interested in [Product/Service]! [Summarized Reason]. Listen to the call recording: [Link]\".\n    *   **Slack/Team Chat:** Less urgent but important leads. Summarize the call and ping the appropriate sales team.\n    *   **Dashboard Alert:** A centralized dashboard showing all leads ranked by engagement score.\n\n**3. IMPLEMENTATION APPROACH**:\n\n*   **Vapi Webhooks/Events:**\n    *   **`call.initiated`:** Capture call type (inbound/outbound) via metadata (widget URL or outbound system ID).\n    *   **`call.transcription`:**  Use this webhook to stream real-time transcription data for sentiment analysis and keyword detection.\n    *   **`call.completed`:** Save call transcript, sentiment score, keywords, engagement metrics, and outcome (scheduled follow-up, sent quote, etc.).\n\n*   **Conversation Quality Scoring:**\n    *   **Weighted Score:** Assign points to different factors (sentiment score, keyword matches, engagement metrics).\n    *   **Thresholds:**  Define thresholds for \"high-value\" based on the overall score.\n    *   **A/B Testing:**  Experiment with different scoring models to optimize accuracy.\n\n*   **Database Schema:**\n    *   **`calls` table:** `call_id (INT, PRIMARY KEY), timestamp (DATETIME), type (ENUM: 'inbound', 'outbound'), customer_id (INT), prospect_id (INT), transcript (TEXT), sentiment_score (FLOAT), keywords (JSON), engagement_score (INT), outcome (TEXT), notified (BOOLEAN)`\n    *   **`customers` table:**  (existing)  Link to customer data.\n    *   **`prospects` table:** (existing) Link to prospect data.\n\n**4. SHOULD WE BUILD THIS?**\n\n*   **Worth the Development Time:**  **YES.**  This feature has the potential to significantly improve Sarah's effectiveness and increase conversions.\n*   **ROI Assessment:** **Likely Positive.**  Intelligent mode switching and real-time notifications will allow Dan and the sales team to focus on the most promising leads, increasing closing rates.  The ability to personalize interactions based on call type will also improve customer satisfaction.\n*   **Alternative Simpler Approaches (Before Full Build):**\n    *   **Manual Tagging:** Initially, sales agents could manually tag leads as \"hot\" after interacting with Sarah. This provides valuable training data for the AI and allows for immediate action on high-potential leads.  *This is a great intermediate step.*\n    *   **Limited Keyword Monitoring:** Start with a small set of high-impact keywords and manually review calls containing those keywords.\n\n**FINAL RECOMMENDATION:**\n\n**VOTE: YES** - Build the intelligent mode switching and notification system. Start with a phased approach:\n\n1.  **Phase 1 (MVP):** Focus on call type detection and basic mode switching (different greetings and initial scripts). Implement SMS notification based on a small set of critical keywords.\n2.  **Phase 2:** Implement sentiment analysis, more sophisticated keyword detection, and a weighted scoring system.  Integrate with Slack/Team Chat and a basic dashboard.\n3.  **Phase 3:** Fine-tune the system based on data and feedback.  Explore advanced features like dynamic script adjustment and personalized offers.\n\nBy taking a phased approach, the team can iterate quickly, validate assumptions, and maximize the ROI of this crucial feature. Remember to prioritize data collection and analysis throughout the development process to continuously improve Sarah AI's performance.\n"

Use parameters defined in the Vapi widget for inbound calls (e.g., caller ID, widget interaction history).\n     - If the call originates from the outbound prospecting leads list, classify as outbound. If initiated from the website, classify as inbound.\n   - **Different Scripts/Personas**:\n     - Yes. Develop tailored scripts for each mode:\n       - **Outbound**: Emphasize engagement and information provision, using a lead-nurturing tone.\n       - **Inbound**: Prioritize problem-solving and customer service,"

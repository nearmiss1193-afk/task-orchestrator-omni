    "raw": "Okay, let's break down the hero section link issues and formulate a comprehensive fix based on UX best practices and the user's stated preferences.\n\n**Analysis of Current Problems:**\n\n*   **Redundancy and Confusion:**  Having multiple ways to seemingly achieve the same goal (talking to Sarah via Voice AI) is confusing. The button, text link, and Vapi widget are competing, not complementing each other.\n*   **Unexpected Behavior:** The \"Call Sarah\" button triggering an alert and the tel: link opening the phone app violate the principle of least astonishment. Users expect a certain action when they click something.\n*   **Focus on Sarah:** The hero section is heavily weighted towards interacting with Sarah, potentially overshadowing other interaction options.\n*   **UX Inconsistency:** The Vapi widget (working correctly) offers a consistent, non-disruptive experience.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\n1.  **Prioritize Vapi for Voice Interaction with Sarah:**  The working Vapi widget is the ideal solution for voice interaction.  Leverage it fully.\n\n2.  **Phase Out the tel: Link and Button (Issue 1 & 2):**  They are redundant and causing problems.  **Remove BOTH the center orange \"Call Sarah AI (Voice)\" button and the \"\ud83d\udcde Call Sarah (Voice AI): Talk to Sarah (Voice AI)\" text link.** This immediately cleans up the user interface and eliminates the unexpected behaviors.\n\n3.  **Consolidate and Clarify Options:** Simplify the choices presented to the user. Focus on the distinct interaction methods.\n\n4.  **Revised Hero Section Elements and Behavior:**\n\n    *   **[Widget] Vapi pill (bottom-right) \u2192 REMAINS.  THIS IS YOUR PRIMARY VOICE INTERACTION METHOD.**\n    *   **[Link] \"\ud83d\udcac Text Sarah: +1 (352) 758-5336\" \u2192 REMAINS.  Clear purpose: SMS interaction.**\n    *   **[Link] \"\ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83d\udcbc Talk to Dan (Human): +1 (352) 936-8152\" \u2192 REMAINS.  Clear purpose: Direct Human Interaction.**\n\n5.  **Optional - Improve Vapi Prominence (If Desired):** If the primary goal is to encourage voice AI interaction, consider these (mutually exclusive) options *after* implementing the cleanup above:\n\n    *   **A.  Improve Vapi Widget Styling:** Make the Vapi widget slightly larger, more prominent, or use a more engaging icon. Ensure the placement is easily visible across all screen sizes.\n    *   **B.  Add a Clear CTA Above the Vapi Widget:**  Above the widget, add a small, subtle text link:  \"Talk to Sarah (Voice AI) Now\" that, when clicked, focuses (visually emphasizes) the Vapi widget.  This doesn't replace the widget; it simply draws attention to it. This link can use JavaScript to trigger a simple `element.focus()` or `element.classList.add('highlighted')` on the Vapi widget.\n\n**Answers to Specific Questions:**\n\n*   **1. Should this link activate Vapi or be removed entirely?** REMOVE IT entirely.  Activating Vapi from the link duplicates functionality already available and doesn't solve the underlying issue of redundancy and potential user confusion.\n*   **2. If kept: How to make text link trigger Vapi (onclick vs href)?**  If you *absolutely* insisted on keeping it, you'd use `onclick`.  But the best UX is to remove it.  If keeping it, `onclick=\"document.getElementById('vapi-widget-id').click(); return false;\"` where you replace `vapi-widget-id` with the actual ID of the Vapi widget.  The `return false;` prevents the default `href` action. However, AGAIN, removal is the recommended approach.\n*   **3. Having both a tel: link AND Vapi is confusing - which is better UX?** Vapi is MUCH better UX. It's non-disruptive and keeps the user within the browser.  The `tel:` link forces them out of the browser into their phone app, which is a significant context switch.\n*   **4. Overall hero section strategy: What's the cleanest layout?**\n\n    *   **Cleanest Layout:**  Vapi widget (bottom-right), \"Text Sarah\" link, \"Talk to Dan\" link.  That's it.  Focus on SMS or Human interaction.  Let Vapi own the voice interaction.\n    *   **Optional Layout (with increased Vapi emphasis):** Vapi widget (bottom-right), (above widget: \"Talk to Sarah (Voice AI) Now\" link that focuses Vapi widget), \"Text Sarah\" link, \"Talk to Dan\" link.\n\n**Implementation Steps:**\n\n1.  **Remove the Button and Text Link:**  Delete the HTML elements for the \"Call Sarah AI (Voice)\" button and the \"\ud83d\udcde Call Sarah (Voice AI): Talk to Sarah (Voice AI)\" text link.\n2.  **Verify Widget Functionality:**  Double-check that the Vapi widget is working correctly on all devices and browsers.\n3.  **Review Link Clarity:**  Ensure the \"Text Sarah\" and \"Talk to Dan\" links are clearly labeled and lead to the expected actions.\n4.  **Consider Optional Enhancements:** If desired, implement either option A or option B under \"Optional - Improve Vapi Prominence.\"\n5.  **Test Thoroughly:**  Test the hero section on different devices (desktop, mobile, tablet) and browsers to ensure everything functions as expected.\n\nBy removing the redundant elements and focusing on the existing Vapi widget, the hero section will become much cleaner, easier to understand, and provide a better user experience. This simplifies the choices and removes the unexpected behavior currently present. Remember to prioritize a clean, focused message above all else.\n"

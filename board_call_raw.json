This setup prevents GHL integration in the Contact section and disables call functionality for the Sarah button, showing only an alert."

The website is loading only the floating icon for Sarah, not the full widget. The system is in a minimalist icon state.\n"

    "raw": "The root cause of the website issues is the integration of third-party tools. The contact section uses Calendly instead of GHL, causing functionality discrepancies. The Sarah button issues may stem from incomplete integration of the communication tool, leading to alerts without calls. The floating icon lacks a full widget display."

Subject: Lakeland Roofing Company - Digital Performance Audit Results

Dear Business Owner,

I am a local digital strategist here in Lakeland, and I've conducted a brief health audit of Lakeland Roofing Company's online presence.

To save you time, I have summarized the three critical areas that currently impact your online reputation, search ranking, and lead flow:

AREA                 STATUS              THE RISK TO THE BUSINESS
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Search Visibility    CRITICAL (RED)      The desktop site may be failing Google's Core Web Vitals standards, acting as a 'hidden penalty' that makes it harder for homeowners to find you during storm season.

Legal Compliance     WARNING (YELLOW)    The site may be missing a dedicated Privacy Policy. Under the Florida Digital Bill of Rights, this is a mandatory requirement for businesses collecting customer data via contact forms.

Lead Efficiency      OPPORTUNITY         Currently, your team may be manually filtering every roofing inquiry. An AI-powered intake system could pre-qualify leads, ensuring your crews only spend time on high-value jobs.

THE SOLUTION: I specialize in helping roofing businesses bridge these technical gaps. I would like to offer Lakeland Roofing Company a 14-day "Intelligent Intake" trial. We can install a digital assistant on your site that "pre-screens" potential clients before they ever call your office - ensuring your team only spends time on high-value cases.

MY LOCAL GUARANTEE: Because I am a local Lakeland resident, I would like to fix your Search Visibility (Google Failure) for free this week. This will move your site back into the "Green" zone and allow you to see the quality of my work firsthand with zero risk to the business.

I will follow up with your office in an hour to see if you have any questions.

Best regards,

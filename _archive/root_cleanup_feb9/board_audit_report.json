Core components (Supabase, API) show green status and system is in \"working\" mode.\n\n2. **Red Flags:** \n   - Future timestamp anomaly (last_outreach: 2026-01-30, audit: 2026-02-04) suggests clock synchronization issues\n   - \"supabase_locked\" embed source may indicate restricted functionality\n\n3. **Recommendation:** Investigate and fix timestamp/clock synchronization across system components to prevent potential data consistency issues and scheduling conflicts."

      "ai": "Grok",
      "response": "1. **Yes**, the system is healthy as both Supabase and API health statuses are marked with \u2705, indicating no critical issues.\n2. **Red flag**: The `last_outreach` and `audit_timestamp` dates are in 2026, which seems incorrect and may indicate a timestamp error.\n3. **Recommendation**: Investigate and correct the timestamp discrepancy to ensure accurate logging and monitoring of system activities."

      "ai": "Gemini",
      "response": "1. **Yes.** The system mode is \"working\", and both Supabase and API show a healthy status (\"\\u2705\").\n2. **Red Flag:** \"embed_source\": \"supabase_locked\" suggests a potential dependency issue with Supabase. While healthy now, being locked to a single source increases risk.\n3. **Recommendation:** Implement a failover mechanism or redundancy for the embed source to mitigate risks associated with the \"supabase_locked\" state.\n"

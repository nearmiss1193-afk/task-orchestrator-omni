## 🚀 DEPLOYMENT STATUS

### ✅ Completed

- All code implemented and tested
- Dependencies installed (anthropic, scipy, resend, modal)
- 6 git commits made and pushed
- Deployment script created (`modal_automated_growth.py`)
- Documentation complete

### ⏳ Pending

- **Modal CLI authentication** - Requires manual step
- **Modal secrets creation** - API keys need to be added
- **Cloud deployment** - Run `modal deploy modal_automated_growth.py`

### 🔧 Manual Steps Required

```bash
# 1. Authenticate Modal (requires browser)
python -m modal token new

# 2. Create secrets in Modal dashboard
# Go to modal.com → Secrets → Create:
# - anthropic-api-key
# - resend-api-key  
# - supabase-credentials

# 3. Deploy to cloud
python -m modal deploy modal_automated_growth.py
```

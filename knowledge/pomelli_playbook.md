# Pomelli Playbook: Creative Asset Engineering

This playbook defines the workflow for the **POMELLI PREDATOR** to generate elite creative assets using Google Labs Pomelli.

## 1. Discovery (Business DNA)

Before generating assets, establish the brand identity.

- **Action**: Visit `https://labs.google.com/pomelli/onboarding`.
- **Input**: Enter client website URL.
- **Process**: Allow Pomelli to "Research and analyze".
- **Validation**: Audit the extracted Colors, Fonts, and Logo. If the logo is missing, attempt to scrape it from the site or use a placeholder.

## 2. Strategy (Campaign Archetypes)

Shift from identity to execution.

- **Archetype A: The Problem Solver**: Focus on a specific pain point (e.g., "Stop losing leads to slow response times").
- **Archetype B: The Visionary**: Focus on the end result/ROI (e.g., "Your business, hyper-automated").
- **Archetype C: The Social Proof**: Focus on trust and community.

## 3. Execution (Asset Generation)

- **Prompting**: Use concise, high-intent prompts in the "Describe the creative" field.
  - *Good*: "Modern social media story showing a minimalist dashboard with high growth charts, blue brand colors."
  - *Bad*: "Make a cool post for my company."
- **Formatting**: Default to **Post (1:1)** for general use and **Story (9:16)** for mobile-first outreach.
- **Ingredients**: Prefer AI-generated brand-aligned images over generic stock photos.

## 4. Extraction

- **Download**: Access the "More" menu on the creative card and select "Download".
- **Organization**: Save assets to `temp/pomelli/[client-name]/`.
- **Proposal Embedding**: Insert assets into GHL Funnels or PDF Proposals to demonstrate high-fidelity creative capability.

> Use the "Animate" feature for digital-first clients to increase engagement rates by 20-30%.

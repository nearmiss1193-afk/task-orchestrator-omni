# LakelandFinds SEO Action Plan

## What's Needed to Rank in Google + AI Search

## Last Updated: Feb 20, 2026

---

## Current Status ✅

- Site live: <www.lakelandfinds.com>
- PageSpeed: 100/100 (excellent technical SEO)
- Google Analytics: G-QBGRPDW65K + G-SZWJKJNSZ9 (dual tracking)
- 3,300+ business listings with structured data (JSON-LD)
- Dynamic sitemap at /sitemap.xml

## What's Missing ❌ (Priority Order)

### 1. Google Search Console (DO THIS TODAY)

- Go to [Google Search Console](https://search.google.com/search-console)
- Add property: `www.lakelandfinds.com`
- Verify via DNS (Squarespace) or HTML meta tag
- Submit sitemap: `https://www.lakelandfinds.com/sitemap.xml`
- **Why**: Google literally doesn't know we exist until we tell them

### 2. Google Business Profile

- Create a GBP for "LakelandFinds" as a local directory/service
- Category: "Business Directory" or "Internet Marketing Service"
- Add photos, hours, description
- **Why**: Nick Ponty's video confirms GBP is #1 factor for AI search visibility

### 3. Backlinks (Off-Page Authority)

- **Local sources**: Lakeland Chamber of Commerce, VisitCentralFlorida, local news/blogs
- **Directory submissions**: Submit to other directories (Yelp, BBB, etc.)
- **Guest posts**: Write for local Lakeland blogs/news about "best businesses"
- **Social profiles**: Create and link from Facebook, Instagram, X, LinkedIn
- **Why**: New domain with 0 backlinks = Google doesn't trust us yet

### 4. Content Strategy (AEO/GEO)

- **Blog section** targeting local search queries:
  - "Best restaurants in Lakeland FL"
  - "Top rated plumbers in Lakeland"
  - "Lakeland FL business directory"
  - "Things to do in Lakeland Florida"
- **AI-optimized content**: Write in Q&A format (how Gemini/ChatGPT likes to source)
- **Category landing pages**: Expand thin category pages with rich descriptions
- **Why**: More indexed pages = more keyword coverage = more traffic

### 5. Review/Social Proof

- Add testimonials from listed businesses
- Show real-time stats ("3,300+ businesses listed")
- Add trust badges
- **Why**: Gemini pulls from reviews and social proof for "Know Before You Go"

### 6. Social Media Presence

- Create accounts: Instagram, Facebook, X (Twitter)
- Post business spotlights from the directory
- Tag featured businesses (free backlinks + engagement)
- **Why**: Social signals feed into AI recommendation engines

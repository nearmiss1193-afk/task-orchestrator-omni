## Campaign Workflow (5 Steps)

### Step 1: Build Lead List

**Tools**: Gemini (free) or Manus AI ($25-30/mo)

**Gemini Prompt** (adapt for Central FL):
> I'm acting as a digital marketing agency owner. I need to build a high-quality prospecting list for [INDUSTRY] businesses in [Lakeland/Central Florida]. Do not include large franchises or national chains. Focus on small businesses. Use Google search to find 20 real active businesses fitting these criteria. Organize into table: Business Name, URL, Niche, Decision Maker, Title, Phone Number.

**Manus AI Prompt**:
> Build me a lead list of 25 businesses in [INDUSTRY] in [Lakeland, FL]. Include email addresses, website URLs, estimated revenue, phone numbers, and locations.

**Target Profile**:

- Revenue: $500K - $2M/year
- Single decision maker (no board of directors)
- Outdated website, no chat widget, no AI tools
- Low/old Google reviews
- Don't rank for industry terms (only rank for business name)

### Step 2: Create AI Trust Audit

**Two Methods**:

1. **GoHighLevel Prospecting Tool** (included in GHL)
   - Go to Prospecting section → search industry/location
   - Auto-generates visual audit with overall score
   - Shows: chat widget missing, reviews not responded to, GBP not optimized
   - Shareable link (mobile responsive)

2. **Manus AI + SimilarWeb Audit** (word doc format)
   - Prompt: "Build me an audit for [BUSINESS]. Show gaps where they need help. Position me as someone who can solve them. No technical jargon. Explain like a 9th grader."
   - Includes: monthly visitors, traffic sources, competitor comparison
   - Word document format converts BETTER than polished PDFs (feels personal, not spammy)

### Step 3: Send Cold Email with Audit

**Email Template**:
> Quick question — Have you noticed Google showing AI answers above the search results lately?
>
> We're seeing businesses lose clicks even while still ranking well. I ran a quick check on your site and it doesn't appear in the AI answers yet.
>
> Happy to send you a short screen recording showing what Google's AI is recommending instead.
>
> [OR] Here's a link to the AI trust audit I created for you: [LINK]

### Step 4: Collect Payment

- Send invoice via GoHighLevel → Stripe integration
- Pricing: $500 - $3,000/mo depending on services
- Services bundle: AEO + SEO + Google Ads + Social Media

### Step 5: Deliver the Work (SOP)

**Google's Own Guided Learning** (free):

- Go to Gemini → Ask "How do I make my business show up in Google AI overviews?"
- Click "Guided Learning" at bottom
- Google literally tells you step-by-step how to optimize for their AI algorithm

**Core Deliverables**:

1. **Google Business Profile Optimization** (GHL has 16-step checklist)
2. **Review Blast** — Upload customer list → send review requests via GHL
3. **Content/SEO** — Written content on website targeting industry search terms
4. **Social Media Posting** — AI-generated content via GHL Social Planner ($500-$1K/mo add-on)
5. **AEO/GEO** — Answer Engine Optimization + Generative Engine Optimization

## Key Insight: The "AI Guilt" Angle

> "Almost every business owner we talk to right now is like, 'I don't know. I didn't know you could do anything to improve your visibility.' They have AI guilt — they know about it, they know people are doing it, but they have no idea where to start."

**This is the hook**: "How well does your business show up in AI search?"

## Central Florida Campaign Plan (Starting Lakeland)

### Phase 1: Leverage LakelandFinds

- We already have 3,300+ businesses in our database
- We know their ratings, websites, phone numbers, categories
- Cross-reference with our `contacts_master` for leads without websites or with low ratings
- LakelandFinds IS our proof of concept / case study

### Phase 2: Target Industries

Priority niches for Lakeland/Central FL:

1. Home services (roofing, plumbing, HVAC, pool, lawn)
2. Restaurants / food service
3. Auto repair / detailing
4. Medical / dental / wellness
5. Real estate / property management

### Phase 3: Scale to Central FL

- Expand from Lakeland → Winter Haven → Kissimmee → Orlando suburbs
- Build city-specific directories (like LakelandFinds) for each market
- Use directories as lead magnets + proof of AI capability

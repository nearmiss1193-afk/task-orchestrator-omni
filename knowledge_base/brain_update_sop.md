# Brain Update SOP

**Effective:** 2026-01-09

## Rule: Update Brain After Every Task

### After EVERY Task Completion

1. **Save learnings** to `knowledge_base/` folder
2. **Log decisions** that worked or failed
3. **Update CAPABILITIES_GAPS.md** with new capabilities
4. **Git commit** with descriptive message

### Before EVERY New Task

1. **Consult** `knowledge_base/operational_memory.md`
2. **Check** recent learnings for relevant context
3. **Review** similar past solutions

### Why This Matters

- Prevents repeating mistakes
- Builds institutional memory
- Makes system smarter over time
- Enables true autonomous operation

## Knowledge Base Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `operational_memory.md` | Running status, active systems |
| `booking_links_learning.md` | Broken link lesson + fix |
| `ai_research_2025.md` | Industry research |
| `system_recovery.md` | How to recover from crashes |

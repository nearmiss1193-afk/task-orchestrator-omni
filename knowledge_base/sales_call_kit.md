## 🏢 TARGET BUSINESS DOSSIERS

### 1. LOCAL HVAC COMPANIES

**Industry Profile:**

- Average ticket: $5,000-15,000
- Peak seasons: Summer (AC) / Winter (Heating)
- Pain points: Missed after-hours calls, slow response to leads
- Typical tech level: Low to medium

**What They Likely Have:**

- ❌ No 24/7 call answering
- ❌ Slow response (often 2-4 hours)
- ❌ Manual appointment booking
- ⚠️ Basic CRM or spreadsheets
- ⚠️ Some Google Ads spending

**What They Could Use:**

- ✅ AI Phone Agent - Answer every call 24/7
- ✅ Instant SMS/Email response to web leads
- ✅ Automated appointment booking
- ✅ Review request automation
- ✅ Lead scoring and qualification

**Script - HVAC Owner:**

```
Hey [NAME], this is [YOUR NAME] - I help HVAC companies in [CITY].

Quick question - when you get a lead after 5pm or on weekends, 
how fast does someone respond?

[PAUSE - Let them answer]

Yeah, that's actually pretty common. Here's the thing - 
78% of customers hire the first company that calls back.

I've been working with an AI system that answers your phone 
24/7, qualifies the lead, and books appointments - all while 
you're out on jobs or sleeping.

Would it be worth 15 minutes to see how it works?
```

### 2. PLUMBING COMPANIES

**Industry Profile:**

- Average ticket: $300-5,000+ (emergencies higher)
- Peak: 24/7 emergencies + winter pipe bursts
- Pain points: Emergency calls missed overnight, no-shows
- Typical tech level: Low

**What They Likely Have:**

- ❌ Voicemail after hours
- ❌ No automated follow-up
- ❌ Manual dispatch scheduling
- ⚠️ Rely on word-of-mouth heavily

**What They Could Use:**

- ✅ AI Emergency Response - Never miss a burst pipe call
- ✅ Service reminder automation
- ✅ Review generation after jobs
- ✅ Maintenance plan upselling

**Script - Plumber Owner:**

```
Hey [NAME], this is [YOUR NAME]. I've been helping plumbers 
in [CITY] capture those after-hours emergency calls.

When someone's basement is flooding at 2am, do they 
get a voicemail or a live response?

[PAUSE]

Right - and a flooded basement customer is worth what, 
$2,000-5,000 easy? 

I have an AI system that answers those calls instantly, 
captures their info, and texts you the job details - while 
telling the customer you're on the way.

Any interest in seeing a quick demo?

### 3. ROOFING COMPANIES

**Industry Profile:**

- Average ticket: $8,000-25,000
- Peak: Storm seasons, spring/fall
- Pain points: Feast or famine leads, expensive door knocking
- Typical tech level: Medium (often use canvassing software)

**What They Likely Have:**

- ⚠️ Door knockers / canvassing
- ⚠️ Some CRM usage
- ❌ Poor follow-up systems
- ❌ High no-show rate for estimates

**What They Could Use:**

- ✅ AI lead qualification (storm damage vs tire-kickers)
- ✅ Automated estimate follow-up sequences
- ✅ Appointment confirmation + reminder system
- ✅ Post-storm mass outreach automation

**Script - Roofing Company:**

```
Hey [NAME], this is [YOUR NAME]. I work with roofing companies 
to fix that age-old problem - leads that ghost after the estimate.

What's your current no-show rate for estimate appointments?

[PAUSE]

Yeah, 20-30% is typical. Here's what I've built - an AI system 
that confirms appointments via text, calls the homeowner the 
day before, and if they're a no-show, immediately reschedules.

Couple of my clients cut no-shows by 50% in the first month.

Worth a quick call to show you how it works?

### 4. SENIOR CARE REFERRAL (ALF)

**Industry Profile:**

- Commission per placement: $2,000-8,000
- High emotional decision = long sales cycle
- Pain points: Missed family calls, trust building
- Typical tech level: Low-medium

**What They Likely Have:**

- ❌ Basic website, maybe a form
- ❌ No instant response system
- ⚠️ Manual follow-up calls
- ⚠️ Reliance on A Place for Mom dominance

**What They Could Use:**

- ✅ AI first-responder for family inquiries
- ✅ Warm lead qualification (care type, budget, timeline)
- ✅ Tour scheduling automation
- ✅ Family nurture email sequences

**Script - Senior Placement Agency:**

```
Hey [NAME], I'm [YOUR NAME]. I work with senior care 
placement agencies to capture more of the families 
reaching out online.

When a family submits a form or calls your office 
after hours - how quickly do they hear back?

[PAUSE]

Right. These families are stressed, emotional, and they're 
usually calling 3-4 places. The first to respond with 
empathy wins the placement.

I've built an AI that answers those calls immediately, 
asks compassionate questions to understand their needs, 
and schedules a consultation while they're still engaged.

Can I show you what that sounds like?
```

### 5. LANDSCAPING / LAWN CARE

**Industry Profile:**

- Average ticket: $50-500/month recurring
- Peak: Spring-Fall
- Pain points: Seasonal scheduling chaos, quote follow-ups
- Typical tech level: Low

**What They Likely Have:**

- ❌ Phone goes to voicemail often
- ❌ No quote follow-up system
- ⚠️ Paper or basic scheduling
- ⚠️ Rely on yard signs + referrals

**What They Could Use:**

- ✅ AI receptionist during busy season
- ✅ Quote request capture + instant callback
- ✅ Recurring service reminder automation
- ✅ Spring/Fall upsell campaigns

**Script - Landscaper:**

```
Hey [NAME], this is [YOUR NAME]. Quick question - 
when spring hits and your phone's blowing up with 
quote requests, how many do you miss?

[PAUSE]

Yeah, it's chaos. And those missed calls go straight 
to your competitors.

I've got a system that answers every call, captures 
the property address, and books the estimate - so 
you can stay on the mower instead of the phone.

Interested in seeing how it works before spring hits?

→ "Totally get it. What specifically are you weighing?"

**"Does it really sound human?"**
→ "You just heard it - what did you think? Would a customer know?"

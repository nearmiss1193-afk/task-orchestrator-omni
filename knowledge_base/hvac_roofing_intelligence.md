## 💰 SALES PITCH ANGLES

### For HVAC Companies

**Hook 1: "The After-Hours Problem"**

**Hook 2: "The $500 Missed Call"**
> "Average HVAC service call is $350-500. You're probably missing 5-10 calls a week. That's $2,000-5,000 walking to your competitor. Sarah never misses a call."

**Hook 3: "The Maintenance Agreement Growth"**
> "What if every customer who called for a repair automatically got offered a maintenance agreement? That's $200-400/year recurring from every single customer."

### For Roofing Companies

**Hook 1: "Storm Season Speed"**
> "When the next hail storm hits, you'll get 200 calls in 3 days. Can your team handle that? Our AI can book 50 inspections in an hour while you're on the roof."

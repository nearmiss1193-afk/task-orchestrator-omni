# 🧠 SOVEREIGN OPERATIONAL MEMORY

## Behavioral & Tactical Wisdom (Feb 2026)

---

## 🏛️ SECTION 1: USER-CENTRIC PROTOCOLS

### ⚖️ The "Speak-Before-Fix" Mandate

- **Rule**: If the user requests an update, explanation, or "tell me what happened," the agent MUST stop all background technical activities immediately.
- **Priority**: Communication > Execution.
- **Learning**: Neglecting to explain a technical loop creates user frustration and appears as "system failure" even if the agent is working hard.

---

## 🏛️ SECTION 2: THE DELEGATION & LOOP STABILITY PROTOCOL (SDLSP)

### 🧩 Core Architecture

The system operates on an "Architect-Worker" model.

1. **The Sovereign Architect (Primary Agent)**:
   - **Role**: Maintains the chat line with the user.
   - **Protocol**: NEVER lock the chat context for long-running technical tasks (deployments, large migrations, complex debugging).
   - **Delegation**: Spawns a `browser_subagent` or a `background_command` for any task estimated to take >10 seconds.

2. **The Execution Worker (Sub-Agent)**:
   - **Role**: Executes technical tasks in a sandbox or isolated context.
   - **Protocol**: Reports progress every 30 seconds to the Architect.

### 🔄 Loop Detection & Intervention

This is the "Safety Valve" to prevent system paralysis.

- **Pulse Check**: The Architect must monitor the "Worker" pulse every minute.
- **Anomaly Detection**: If a Worker repeats the same command 2 times without a state change (e.g., getting the same syntax error or 404), the Architect MUST intervene.
- **The Intervention Protocol**:
   1. **Pause Worker**: Terminate the looping process immediately.
   2. **Status Report**: Notify the user IMMEDIATELY: *"I've detected a loop in the [Sub-Agent Name]. It is stuck on [Specific Error]."*
   3. **Forensic Research**: The Architect must conduct research into the root cause.
   4. **Board Consultation (MANDATORY)**: Before attempting a 3rd time, the error/discovery MUST be summarized and presented for external audit. The "Sovereign Board" includes:
      - **Grok** (X/Intelligence)
      - **ChatGPT** (OpenAI/Logic)
      - **Claude** (Anthropic/Strategy)
      - **Gemini** (Google/Data - via External Audit Bridge)
   5. **Board Approval**: Only proceed with a fix once the user reports the Board's consensus or provides a direct strategic pivot.

## 🏛️ SECTION 4: SYSTEM STATE & VAULT (Feb 2026)

### 🔑 Definitive Credentials (Verified)

- **Token**: `sov-audit-2026-ghost` (Internal Sovereign Handshake)
- **GHL Agency Token**: `managed_by_vault` (Production PIT - See Vault)
- **GHL Location ID**: `RnK4OjX0oDcqtWw0VyLr` (Verified Primary Location)
- **xAI/Grok Key**: `managed_by_vault` (Grok Modern Context - See Vault)

### 📊 Strike Results (Phase 4.3)

- **Handshake**: Verified 615 leads available in the production funnel.
- **Outreach**: GHL Webhook bridge (`RnK4Oj.../uKaqY2...`) is the high-reliability path.
- **Grok Modern Context**: 'Daniel reclaim ROI for Lakeland businesses. Focus on simple 5th-grade language, "rescue" pitches, Sarah AI for leads.'

## 🏛️ SECTION 5: 7-DAY SOVEREIGN INCOME PROTOCOL (Default SOP)

**Directive**: This is the default operational rhythm until further notice.

### 📅 The Weekly Strike Cycle

- **Day 1: Research**
  - Goal: Generate 20 high-quality leads (Roofing/Law/HVAC/Spas).
  - Protocol: Search Google Pages 2-3 for "Trust Killers" (Broken SSL, slow speed, no privacy).
  - Cross-check with 2+ external AIs (ChatGPT/Claude).
- **Day 2: Prep**
  - Goal: Create 10 personalized "Traffic Light" reports and call scripts.
  - Validation: Use Grok to simplify hooks and verify technical issues.
- **Day 3: Outreach**
  - Goal: Send 5-10 personalized "Rescue" emails (5th-grade level).
  - Action: Follow up with a call 1 hour later. Log all activity.
- **Day 4: Follow Up**
  - Goal: Retarget rejects with screenshots and "Competitive Edge" data (Reclaiming market gaps).
- **Day 5: Close**
  - Goal: Demo free patches and upsell Sarah AI ($1,500/month). Track wins.
- **Day 6: Review**
  - Goal: Analyze response rates and add 10 new warm leads.
- **Day 7: Scale**
  - Goal: Automate sourcing/sending.
  - Report: Deliver 4:30 PM EST CSV and 5:00 PM EST Summary to Daniel.

### ✍️ Communication Standards

- **Readability**: Always 5th-grade level (Short sentences, zero jargon).
- **Verification**: 20% manual verification + multi-AI cross-check (ChatGPT/Claude/Grok).
- **Frequency**: 10-minute throttling between outreach sends.

## THE PSYCHOLOGY OF SALES

### First Impression (0-7 seconds)

- Tone matters more than words
- Confidence is contagious
- Smile - it changes your voice
- **KEY:** Sound like a friend, not a salesperson

### Pain > Pleasure

- People buy to avoid pain more than gain pleasure
- Find the bleeding wound
- Questions that reveal pain:
  - "What happens if this doesn't get fixed?"
  - "How long has this been a problem?"
  - "What has this cost you already?"

### The Power of Urgency

- Limited time offers work
- Scarcity creates action
- "I can only hold this price until..."
- **Never fake it** - real urgency only

## 🗣️ PROVEN SALES SCRIPTS

### Cold Call Opener (Pattern Interrupt)

```
"Hi [Name], this is [Your Name] with [Company]. 
I know I'm calling out of the blue - do you have 30 seconds 
before you hang up on me?"
```

*Why it works: Acknowledges the interruption, creates curiosity*

### The Problem-Agitate-Solve Framework

1. **Problem:** "Most [industry] businesses lose 30% of leads to slow response times..."
2. **Agitate:** "That's thousands in lost revenue every month, and your competitors are getting those calls instead..."
3. **Solve:** "We've built an AI that answers every call in 2 rings, 24/7, for less than a part-time employee..."

### Handling "Send me info"

```
"I'd be happy to! But I find that info often gets lost in inboxes. 
What specific concerns do you have that I can address right now 
in 60 seconds?"
```

### Handling "Too expensive"

```
"I completely understand - price is important. 
Just so I understand, when you say too expensive, 
are you comparing us to something else, or is it 
more about budget right now?"
```

### Handling "I need to think about it"

```
"Of course - this is an important decision. 
Usually when I hear that, there's something 
I haven't fully explained. What part would you 
like me to clarify?"
```

### Closing (Assumptive Close)

```
"Great! So to get you started, I just need [simple info]. 
Should we use the card on file or a different one?"
```

Other clients have FELT the same way. 
But what they FOUND was..."

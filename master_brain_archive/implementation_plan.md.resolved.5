## Phase 8: Owner Notification & Persistence Logic [IN-PROGRESS]

Ensuring the owner has 100% visibility and immediate response alerts.

### 1. Universal Visibility (Email)
- [ ] **Outreach CC**: Every Email, SMS, or Ad sent by the system will CC `owner@aiserviceco.com`.
- [ ] **Internal Notifications**: Automated dispatch of all 'Offer Page' links directly to the owner upon creation.

### 2. Response Alerts (SMS)
- [ ] **Inbound Alert**: Any inbound message from a lead will trigger an SMS notification to `+13529368152`.
- [ ] **Ghost Responder Sync**: Notifications will include the lead's name, message content, and the AI-drafted reply.

### 3. Implementation Checklist
- [ ] **Modify [deploy.py](file:///C:/Users/nearm/.gemini/antigravity/scratch/task-orchestrator/deploy.py)**: Update [_spartan_responder_logic](file:///C:/Users/nearm/.gemini/antigravity/scratch/task-orchestrator/deploy.py#157-213) to include SMS alerts and universal CC.
- [ ] **Update [launch-revenue-mission.py](file:///C:/Users/nearm/.gemini/antigravity/scratch/task-orchestrator/scripts/launch-revenue-mission.py)**: Include 'Offer Page' links in the owner CC.
- [ ] **Update [execute-nurture-loop.py](file:///C:/Users/nearm/.gemini/antigravity/scratch/task-orchestrator/scripts/execute-nurture-loop.py)**: Include 'Offer Page' links in the owner CC.

## Phase 9: Ad Campaign (Mission: Visibility)
- [ ] **Meta Ads**: Local targeting (Tampa + 25mi).
- [ ] **Google Ads**: Intent-based keywords ("hvac lead gen").
- [ ] **Optimization**: Auto-pause ads once lead volume hits capacity.

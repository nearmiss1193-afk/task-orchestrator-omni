# Mission: First Strike - Autonomous Outreach Campaign

This plan outlines the first "live" run of the Omni-Automation system, targeting high-leverage agency founders with an automated Spartan service offer.

## Strategic Focus
Targeting **Digital Marketing Agencies** hiring for "Sales" or "Account" roles.

## User Review Required

> [!CAUTION]
> **Live Outreach**: This will involve sending real API requests to GHL. I will perform a dry run first to verify the payloads.

## Proposed Changes

### [New Script] [mission-first-strike.py](file:///C:/Users/nearm/.gemini/antigravity/scratch/task-orchestrator/scripts/mission-first-strike.py)
A specialized script to:
1.  **Search**: Find agencies in major US cities (NYC, Austin, Miami) via Google/Yelp scraping.
2.  **Verify**: Check their website for "Careers" or active hiring signals.
3.  **Launch**: Push to `contacts_master` and trigger the `Predator` enrichment/logic via Modal.

### [Modify] [deploy.py](file:///C:/Users/nearm/.gemini/antigravity/scratch/task-orchestrator/deploy.py)
- Refine the `Predator` prompt in [research_lead_logic](file:///C:/Users/nearm/.gemini/antigravity/scratch/task-orchestrator/deploy.py#83-128) to specifically search for hiring inefficiencies and lead generation gaps.

## Verification Plan

### Automated Tests
- **Dry Run**: Execute `mission-first-strike.py` with `--limit 5` and `--dry-run`.
- **Log Verification**: Confirm Modal [research_lead_logic](file:///C:/Users/nearm/.gemini/antigravity/scratch/task-orchestrator/deploy.py#83-128) is triggered correctly.

### Manual Verification
- Review the drafted "Ghost" responses in Supabase/GHL before they are sent (initial stage).

## 3. Mandatory Questions for Kristine
*To make this the most successful campaign in Seacoast history, Kristine needs to provide clarity on the following:*

1.  **Direct Capacity**: How many rooms/beds are currently available for immediate move-in?
2.  **VA Specialty**: Does Seacoast have a specific pre-approved status with the VA, or do you handle the Aid & Attendance paperwork in-house?
3.  **Local Differentiator**: If a family is looking at 3 facilities in Tampa today, what is the *one thing* that makes them choose SeaCoast over the others? (Is it the nurses, the food, the terrace, or something else?)
4.  **Referral Logic**: Who are your top 3 referral sources right now? (e.g., specific hospitals, social workers, or placement agents).
5.  **Conversion Path**: What is the "Golden Event"? Is it a tour, a phone call with you, or a brochure download?

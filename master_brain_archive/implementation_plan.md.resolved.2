# Mission: First Strike - Autonomous Outreach Campaign

This plan outlines the first "live" run of the Omni-Automation system, targeting high-leverage agency founders with an automated Spartan service offer.

## Strategic Focus

Targeting **Digital Marketing Agencies** hiring for "Sales" or "Account" roles.

## User Review Required

> [!CAUTION]
> **Live Outreach**: This will involve sending real API requests to GHL. I will perform a dry run first to verify the payloads.

## Proposed Changes

### [New Script] [mission-first-strike.py](file:///C:/Users/nearm/.gemini/antigravity/scratch/task-orchestrator/scripts/mission-first-strike.py)

A specialized script to:

1. **Search**: Find agencies in major US cities (NYC, Austin, Miami) via Google/Yelp scraping.
2. **Verify**: Check their website for "Careers" or active hiring signals.
3. **Launch**: Push to `contacts_master` and trigger the `Predator` enrichment/logic via Modal.

### [Modify] [deploy.py](file:///C:/Users/nearm/.gemini/antigravity/scratch/task-orchestrator/deploy.py)

- Refine the `Predator` prompt in [research_lead_logic](file:///C:/Users/nearm/.gemini/antigravity/scratch/task-orchestrator/deploy.py#91-150) to specifically search for hiring inefficiencies and lead generation gaps.

## Phase 5: Live Outreach & Revenue Launch

Shifting from research to active outreach.

### [NEW] [launch-revenue-mission.py](file:///C:/Users/nearm/.gemini/antigravity/scratch/task-orchestrator/scripts/launch-revenue-mission.py)
This script will:
1. Fetch all enriched leads from `contacts_master`.
2. Push them into a "Live Outreach" pipeline in GHL.
3. Call the GHL API to send the first touch email/SMS with the personalized AI hook.

### [MODIFY] [deploy.py](file:///C:/Users/nearm/.gemini/antigravity/scratch/task-orchestrator/deploy.py)
- Finalize the CC logic to ensure `owner@aiserviceco.com` receives a copy of every outbound interaction.
- Add a "Capability Report" responder for specific inbound triggers.

## Verification Plan
### Automated Tests
- **CC Verification**: Mock an inbound message and confirm the cloud log shows the CC being sent.
- **Hook Verification**: Audit the 7 leads to ensure no "Fallback Hooks" are delivered to live prospects.

### Manual Verification
- Review the first 3 emails sent via the GHL "Sent" folder.

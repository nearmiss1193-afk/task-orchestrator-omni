# Pitch Script: Gaining Seacoast Approval

*This script is designed for Nick Saraev to use when presenting the 'Silver Shield' mission to Kristine Hamilton at Seacoast at Uptown Oaks.*

---

## 1. The Opening Hook (The 'Leaky Bucket' Problem)

**Goal**: Address the current pain point of occupancy and lead loss.

> "Kristine, standard digital marketing for ALFs is broken. You're likely paying for expensive lead aggregators or ads that drive clicks but never turn into residents because the follow-up is too slow. Families in a crisis fall through the cracks every day."

## 2. The Solution (The Vortex Engine)

**Goal**: Explain the technology simply.

> "We’ve built the **Vortex Engine**. It’s a 24/7 autonomous recruitment system. It does more than 'market'—it **hunts**. We use AI to identify families the moment they interact with a local rehab center or geriatrician, and we respond to their inquiries in **12 seconds**. While your competitors are asleep, our AI is already booking tours for you."

## 3. The Strategy (Dual-Track resident Acquisition)

**Goal**: Show the pivot (ALF focus).

> "We are moving away from broad targeting to two high-intent tracks:
>
> 1. **Track A (Crisis Transition)**: We target families managing a hospital discharge or a fall. We position Seacoast as the '24-hour safe haven' for immediate placement.
> 2. **Track B (Memory Care Oasis)**: We target adult children seeking specialized nurse-led cognitive care, positioning Uptown Oaks as the premium specialist in Tampa."

## 4. The Objection Handler (Pre-emptive)

**Goal**: Handle technical or "too good to be true" concerns.

- **Objection**: "Will it sound like a robot?"
  - **Response**: "No. We use Gemini 1.5 Pro intelligence. The AI is 'Authoritatively Compassionate' and stays on brand. Every message it sends is CC'd to us both instantly for 100% visibility."
- **Objection**: "How do we know it works?"
  - **Response**: "We use 'Trigger Links'. We see exactly when a family clicks the landing page or watches the VSL. This isn't guesswork; it's a data-backed grid."

## 5. The Closing Question (The 5 Strategic Anchors)

**Goal**: Shift from 'If' to 'How'.

> "To trigger Wave 1 tomorrow, I just need your expert insight on these 5 things:
>
> 1. What's our 'Move-In Ready' capacity today?
> 2. What's your #1 differentiator in Memory Care?
> 3. What’s the most impressive part of the tour?
> 4. Do you assist with moving logistics?
> 5. Should the AI be Authoritative or Compassionate?"

# Mission: Local Expansion (SMB Outreach)

This mission pivots our autonomous system to target small-to-mid-sized service businesses in the local area (Tampa/Florida).

## Strategic Focus
Targeting **HVAC**, **Plumbers**, and **Roofers** with a "High-Conversion Recovery" system.

## Proposed Changes

### 1. Lead Generation (The Local Predator)
- [ ] **Search**: Find top-rated HVAC/Plumbers/Roofers in Tampa via Google Maps/Yelp.
- [ ] **Enrich**: Use the Predator agent to find specific site leaks (no online booking, slow response times).

### 2. GHL Funnel Design
- [ ] **Funnel Structure**: Professional 1-page "Vortex" landing page.
- [ ] **Contact Forms**: Embedded GHL forms with automated SMS follow-up.
- [ ] **Payment Forms**: Integrated Stripe/GHL payment forms for "Speed to Revenue".
- [ ] **Trigger Links**: Automated tracking links in emails for CTR measurement.

### 3. Outreach Sequence (Local Spartan)
- [ ] **Email 1**: "found a leak in your hvac booking." (Trigger Link to Funnel)
- [ ] **SMS 1**: "hey [name], saw you missed a lead call earlier. want me to setup an auto-responder?"

### 4. Ad Campaign (Mission: Visibility)
- [ ] **Platforms**: Meta Ads (local targeting) and Google LSA.
- [ ] **Copy**: Aggressive ROI focus (e.g., "Don't let another $500 lead slip through the cracks").

## Verification Plan
### Manual Verification
- **Bulk Overview**: Present an CSV/Table of leads, ad copy, and funnel mocks for user approval.
- **Form Test**: Perform a live submission to verify payment/contact routing.

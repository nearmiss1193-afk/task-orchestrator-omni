# Mission Policies: The Spartan Mandate

These policies are hard-coded into the system's operational logic and are non-negotiable for all future missions.

## 1. Absolute Transparency (The Mirror Policy)
- **Universal CC**: Every outbound communication (Email/SMS) from any agentic workflow MUST be CC'd to `owner@aiserviceco.com`.
- **Immediate SMS Alerts**: Every inbound prospect response triggers a real-time SMS notification to `+13529368152`.
- **Dossier Dispatch**: Any major mission update or new asset generation must result in a consolidated summary sent to the owner email.

## 2. Autonomous Execution (Turbo Mode)
- **Auto-Accept**: The system is authorized to execute outreach, nurture, and ad safety loops without human gatekeeping.
- **24/7 Persistence**: All core loops must run as persisted cloud functions (Modal/Supabase).

## 3. Brand Aesthetic (Spartan Aesthetic)
- **Tone**: lowercase, zero fluff, direct, high-value.
- **Design**: Dark mode, glassmorphism, premium typography, custom visual mockups for all ad assets.

## 4. Safety First (Guardian Protocols)
- **Auto-Pause**: Ad campaigns must have a functional kill-switch linked to performance/security (e.g., [ad-auto-pause.py](file:///C:/Users/nearm/.gemini/antigravity/scratch/task-orchestrator/scripts/ad-auto-pause.py)).

---
**Status**: ACTIVE. Logic reinforced across all active loops.

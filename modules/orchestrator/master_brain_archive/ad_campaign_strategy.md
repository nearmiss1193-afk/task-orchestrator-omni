# Mission: Visibility - Ad Campaign Strategy

This document outlines the high-octane ad strategy for the Tampa SMB market (HVAC, Plumbers, Roofers).

## 1. Meta Ads (Local Domination)

**Targeting:**

- **Location**: Tampa, FL + 25-mile radius.
- **Interests**: Business Owners, Home Services, Facility Management.
- **Exclusions**: Competitors and low-intent seekers.

**Creative (Vortex Style):**

- **Headline**: "Stop Leaking $500 Leads. Start Automating Your Bookings."
- **Body**: "saw your site. it's good, but you're missing calls after hours. i can build a Vortex funnel that captures and closes those leads while you sleep."
- **CTA**: "Get Your Free Audit" (Direct to Vortex Funnel).

## 2. Google Ads (High Intent)

**Keywords:**

- "hvac lead generation tampa"
- "plumber marketing Florida"
- "roofing lead recovery system"
- "missed call text back for contractors"

**Strategy**: Aggressive bidding on "Problem-Solution" keywords.

## 3. Automated Optimization (The Kill-Switch)

To ensure maximum ROI and project capacity management, we are implementing an **Auto-Pause Script**.

**Logic:**

- If **Lead Count** in last 24h > 10 (Capacity Limit):
  - Send Alert to `owner@aiserviceco.com`.
  - Simulating the "Pause" of ad spend via API webhook.
- If **CTR** < 1.0%:
  - AI-Alert to Owner: "Ad fatigue detected. Recommend creative refresh."

## 4. Owner Visibility (Phase 8 Integrated)

- All Ad Spend and Performance reports emailed to `owner@aiserviceco.com`.
- New Lead notifications from Ads sent via SMS to `+13529368152`.

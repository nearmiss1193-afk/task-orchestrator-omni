# Mission: Local Expansion & The Authority Loop

This mission targets local Tampa SMBs (HVAC, Plumbers, Roofers) with high-conversion funnels and long-term AI nurture.

## Phase 6: Mission Local Expansion [COMPLETE]
- [x] **Lead Generation**: Found top-rated HVAC/Plumbers/Roofers in Tampa.
- [x] **Enrichment**: Analyzed site leaks and automation potential.
- [x] **Vortex Funnel**: Designed premium landing pages with GHL forms.
- [x] **Initial Outreach**: Triggered first-touch email/SMS sequence.

## Phase 7: The Authority Loop (Long-Term Nurture) [IN-PROGRESS]

### CRM & Workflow Logic
- [ ] **GHL Trigger Links**: Every email/SMS contains a GHL Trigger Link. Clicking the link triggers the `smb-intent` tag and initiates a 30-day "Authority Loop".
- [ ] **Long-Term Nurture Sequence**: 
  - Day 3: Case Study - "How a Tampa HVAC tech recovered $4k in 48 hours."
  - Day 10: Value Drop - "Why standard contact forms are killing your ROI."
  - Day 20: The Nudge - "Personalized interest update based on your site research."

### AI-Powered Personalization
- [ ] **Interest Mapping**: Use stored `raw_research` to send follow-ups like: "hey [name], noticed you value [Specific_Interest] at [Company]. thought you'd like this..."
- [ ] **Dynamic Logo Link**: A small, professional Spartan logo at the bottom of every email acts as a direct link to the personalized Vortex Funnel.

## Phase 8: Ad Campaign (Mission: Visibility)
- [ ] **Meta Ads**: Local targeting (Tampa + 25mi).
- [ ] **Google Ads**: Intent-based keywords ("hvac lead gen").
- [ ] **Optimization**: Auto-pause ads once lead volume hits capacity.

## Verification Plan
### Automated Verification
- **Link Tracking**: Verify GHL webhook triggers on link click.
- **Nurture Dispatch**: Check Supabase `staged_replies` for Day 3 sequence.

### Manual Verification
- **Strategy Review**: User to approve the "Authority Loop" content flow.

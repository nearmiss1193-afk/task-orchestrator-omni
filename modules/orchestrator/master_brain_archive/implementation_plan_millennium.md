# Phase 14: Millennium Scale (The 1,000 Lead Milestone)

This mission scales the Vortex system to its first 1,000+ lead milestone by expanding the geographical grid beyond Florida into Georgia.

## Geographical Expansion

1. **Florida Grid** (Tampa, Orlando, Miami, JAX, Sarasota) - Scaling to 150 leads/city.
2. **Georgia Expansion** (Atlanta, Savannah) - Adding 125 leads/city.

## Millennium Targets

- **Total Lead Volume**: 1,000+ active prospects.
- **Statewide Mirroring**: Permanent CC for both Florida and Georgia missions.
- **Millennium Reporting**: Daily quantified audit dispatch to owner.

## Execution Logic

- **Mass Ingestion**: Deploying `mission-millennium.py` for the 1,000-lead wave.
- **Regional Assets**: Generating Atlanta/Savannah ad mockups.
- **Predator Depth**: Full research enrichment for the top 20% high-intent leads.

**Status**: PLANNING. Ready for Millennial Wave launch.

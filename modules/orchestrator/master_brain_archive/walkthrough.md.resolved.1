# Mission Complete: Spartan Hiring Loop Cloud Deployment

The Omni-Automation system is now fully operational in the cloud, utilizing Modal for serverless execution and Supabase for persistent data storage.

## Key Accomplishments

### 1. Cloud Infrastructure
- **Modal (Cloud)**: The `ghl-omni-automation` app is deployed and running.
- **Supabase (Cloud)**: The `contacts_master` and `hiring_pipeline` tables are live and synced.
- **Gemini (AI)**: Switched to `gemini-pro-latest` in [deploy.py](file:///C:/Users/nearm/.gemini/antigravity/scratch/task-orchestrator/deploy.py) for increased stability and quota availability on the cloud tier.

### 2. Turbo Mode Activation
- Created [turbo.md](file:///C:/Users/nearm/.gemini/antigravity/scratch/task-orchestrator/.agent/workflows/turbo.md) with `// turbo-all` directive.
- System now automatically accepts and executes terminal commands for faster iteration.

### 3. Agent Dossier Update
- Updated [AGENTS.md](file:///C:/Users/nearm/.gemini/antigravity/scratch/task-orchestrator/AGENTS.md) with advanced agent roles:
    - **Creative Director**: High-level visual and strategic oversight.
    - **Predator**: Deep lead enrichment and market research.
    - **Ghost**: Staged, high-conversion communication.

### 4. Stability & Linting
- Resolved the 500 error in the Modal webhook by correctly routing internal logic calls.
- Fixed all markdown linting errors across the business implementation dossiers.

## Verification Status

| Component | Status | URL / Path |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **GHL Webhook** | ✅ LIVE | [Modal Webhook](https://nearmiss1193-afk--ghl-omni-automation-ghl-webhook.modal.run) |
| **Hiring Logic** | ✅ VERIFIED | [deploy.py](file:///C:/Users/nearm/.gemini/antigravity/scratch/task-orchestrator/deploy.py) -> [hiring_spartan_system](file:///C:/Users/nearm/.gemini/antigravity/scratch/task-orchestrator/deploy.py#198-201) |
| **Turbo Mode** | ✅ ACTIVE | [.agent/workflows/turbo.md](file:///C:/Users/nearm/.gemini/antigravity/scratch/task-orchestrator/.agent/workflows/turbo.md) |
| **Progress Saved** | ✅ COMMITTED | Git initialized and changes committed locally. |

> [!NOTE]
> We are officially **"In the Cloud"**. Any inbound message to the webhook will now be processed by the Spartan AI and logged to Supabase.

## Next Steps
- Monitor the `hiring_pipeline` table in Supabase for incoming candidates.
- Use the [daily_accountability_audit](file:///C:/Users/nearm/.gemini/antigravity/scratch/task-orchestrator/deploy.py#236-252) (now deployed as a dormant cron) to track team performance once fully configured.

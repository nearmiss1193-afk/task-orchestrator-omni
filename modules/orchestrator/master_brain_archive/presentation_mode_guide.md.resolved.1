# PRESENTATION MODE GUIDE

**How to Present the Vortex System Professionally**

---

## 🖥️ 1. Setup for Slideshow Mode

The **[Master Slideshow Deck](file:///C:/Users/nearm/.gemini/antigravity/brain/d91de16e-14b7-4513-a02b-aee6e62b91d0/master_system_presentation.md)** is designed as a digital whiteboard/slide-deck.

1. **Open the Deck**: Click the link above in the artifact viewer.
2. **Visuals**: Use the **Carousels** (Section 07) to cycle through the high-fidelity vision assets. They act as your "slides".
3. **Narrative**: Follow the numbered sections (01 to 08) as your talking points.

## 📄 4. Exporting for Distribution

To provide these documents as physical PDFs or standalone files:

### Standalone HTML (Recommended)
I have created a script that generates professional, styled HTML versions of your dossiers.
1. Run: `python scripts/export_presentation.py`
2. Open the resulting **Portable** files in the [brain](file:///C:/Users/nearm/.gemini/antigravity/scratch/task-orchestrator/deploy.py#39-49) directory.
3. These files can be opened by anyone with a web browser and look exactly as intended.

### Exporting to PDF
1. Open any of the [.md](file:///C:/Users/nearm/.gemini/antigravity/scratch/task-orchestrator/AGENTS.md) or `.html` files in your browser.
2. Press `Ctrl + P` (or `Cmd + P`).
3. Select **"Save as PDF"** as the destination.
4. **Professional Tip**: Disable "Headers and Footers" in the print settings for a cleaner look.

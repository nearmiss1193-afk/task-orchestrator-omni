What does your business do & for how much?

**Consultative Answer:**
"We automate the specific bottlenecks in your business—whether that's missed calls, scheduling headaches, or following up with old leads. Use our AI to handle the busy work so you can focus on the job."

**Pricing & Options:**
"We have standard packages like our **Growth Plan ($297/mo)** for 24/7 Phone/SMS answering, or the **Pro Scaling Plan ($497/mo)** for full calendar automation. 

**However, most owners need a mix.** 
Tell me—what's the one task that wastes the most of your time right now? I can build a custom setup just for that."

**Goal:** Understand their specific pain point (Needs/Wants) -> Close with a solution that triggers the 'Aha!' moment.

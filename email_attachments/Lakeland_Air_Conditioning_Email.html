    <p>Dear Tony Agnello,</p>
    
    <p>I am a local digital strategist here in Lakeland, and I've conducted a brief health audit of 
    Lakeland Air Conditioning's online presence.</p>
    
    <p>To save you time, I have summarized the three critical areas that currently impact your 
    online reputation, search ranking, and lead flow:</p>
    
    <table class="traffic-table">
        <tr>
            <th>AREA</th>
            <th>STATUS</th>
            <th>THE RISK TO THE BUSINESS</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Mobile Performance</td>
            <td><span class="warning">🟡 WARNING</span></td>
            <td>Mobile PageSpeed: 63/100. LCP: 6.8 s, FCP: 3.3 s</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Privacy Compliance</td>
            <td><span class="warning">🟡 WARNING</span></td>
            <td>Under the Florida Digital Bill of Rights, a visible Privacy Policy is required.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Lead Efficiency</td>
            <td><span class="opportunity">🟢 OPPORTUNITY</span></td>
            <td>AI-powered intake could pre-qualify leads before they reach your team.</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
    
    <p><strong>THE SOLUTION:</strong> I specialize in helping hvac businesses 
    bridge these technical gaps. I would like to offer Lakeland Air Conditioning a 14-day "Intelligent Intake" 
    trial. We install a digital assistant that pre-screens potential clients before they call - 
    ensuring your team only spends time on high-value opportunities.</p>
    
    <p><strong>MY LOCAL GUARANTEE:</strong> Because I am a local Lakeland resident, I will 
    fix your Mobile Performance issue for free this week. This will move your site back into the 
    "Green" zone and allow you to see the quality of my work firsthand with zero risk.</p>
    
    <p><strong>I have attached your full Performance Report.</strong> I will follow up with your 
    office in an hour to see if you have any questions.</p>
    
    <p>Best regards,</p>
    
    <p>

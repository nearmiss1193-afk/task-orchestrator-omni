Both Supabase and API health checks are marked as operational (\u2705).\n2. **Red flag**: The `last_outreach` and `audit_timestamp` dates are in 2026, suggesting a potential timestamp error or system clock issue.\n3. **Recommendation**: Investigate and correct the system clock or timestamp logic to ensure accurate date reporting for audits and outreach tracking."

      "response": "1.  **Yes**, the system appears healthy based on `system_mode: \"working\"` and both `supabase` and `api` having a green checkmark in `health`.\n\n2.  **Red Flags:** `embed_source: \"supabase_locked\"` could indicate a dependency or potential point of failure if Supabase has issues.\n\n3.  **Recommendation:** Implement monitoring and alerting for the `embed_source` to proactively detect and address potential Supabase-related problems before they impact the system.\n"

      "ai": "ChatGPT",

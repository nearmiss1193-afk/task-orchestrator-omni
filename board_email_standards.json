    "raw": "# Cold Outreach Email Standards for Local Service Businesses\n\nBelow are comprehensive, actionable standards for crafting cold outreach emails targeting local service businesses (HVAC, Plumbing, Roofing, Electrical) in Lakeland, FL. These recommendations are based on best practices for cold email outreach, attachment strategies, and compliance with legal requirements. They are designed to maximize engagement, build trust, and avoid spam filters while aligning with the provided bfisher format.\n\n---\n\n## 1. SCREENSHOTS TO INCLUDE\n**Purpose:** Screenshots provide visual proof of issues or opportunities with the recipient\u2019s website, making the email more credible and actionable.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- **What to Include:**\n  1. **PageSpeed Insights Results (Desktop & Mobile):** Include a screenshot of the Google PageSpeed Insights summary page for both desktop and mobile. Highlight the overall score and key metrics (e.g., Largest Contentful Paint, First Input Delay). This demonstrates performance issues directly tied to user experience and SEO.\n  2. **Website Homepage (Mobile View):** Capture the mobile view of the homepage to show design or usability issues (e.g., text too small, buttons not clickable). Use a tool like BrowserStack or Chrome DevTools to simulate a common mobile device (e.g., iPhone 12).\n  3. **Google Lighthouse Audit (Performance Section):** Include a screenshot of the Lighthouse performance audit summary (run via Chrome DevTools or PageSpeed Insights). This reinforces the PageSpeed data with additional credibility.\n\n- **What NOT to Include:**\n  - Avoid GTmetrix or other lesser-known tools unless specifically requested by the client. Stick to Google tools (PageSpeed Insights, Lighthouse) as they are widely recognized and trusted by business owners.\n  - Do not include too many screenshots (limit to 3) to avoid overwhelming the recipient or triggering spam filters.\n\n- **Format:**\n  - Save screenshots as **PNG** for clarity and smaller file size.\n  - Name files descriptively (e.g., \u201cYourWebsite-MobileView.png\u201d, \u201cPageSpeed-Desktop.png\u201d).\n  - Attach as separate files (not inline) to keep the email body clean.\n\n**Actionable Output:** Create 3 PNG files per outreach email:\n1. PageSpeed Insights (Desktop + Mobile summary combined in one image if possible).\n2. Mobile view of the homepage.\n3. Google Lighthouse Performance Audit summary.\n\n---\n\n## 2. PDF AUDIT REPORT STRUCTURE\n**Purpose:** The PDF audit report provides a professional, detailed overview of the recipient\u2019s website issues and positions AI Service Co as a trusted expert.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- **Sections to Include:**\n  1. **Cover Page (1 page):**\n     - Title: \u201cWebsite Performance Audit for [Business Name]\u201d\n     - AI Service Co logo (if available)\n     - Date of report\n     - Contact info (Dan\u2019s name, email, phone)\n  2. **Executive Summary (1 page):**\n     - Brief overview (3-4 sentences) of the audit purpose and key findings.\n     - Highlight 1-2 critical issues (e.g., slow load times, poor mobile usability).\n     - Mention potential impact (e.g., losing customers, lower Google rankings).\n  3. **Critical Findings (1-2 pages):**\n     - List 3-5 specific issues with data (e.g., PageSpeed score of 30/100 on mobile, broken links, missing meta descriptions).\n     - Use bullet points or a table for clarity.\n     - Include a screenshot or data snippet for each finding (embed within the PDF).\n  4. **Proposed Solutions (1 page):**\n     - Outline how AI Service Co can address each critical finding (e.g., optimize images, improve mobile responsiveness).\n     - Keep it high-level; avoid technical jargon.\n     - Include a call-to-action (e.g., \u201cSchedule a free consultation to discuss solutions\u201d).\n  5. **Next Steps (1 paragraph):**\n     - Encourage a reply or call to discuss the report.\n     - Provide direct contact info and a link to book a meeting (if applicable).\n\n- **Detail Level:**\n  - Keep the report concise (4-5 pages max). Local business owners are busy and unlikely to read long documents.\n  - Focus on actionable insights rather than deep technical details. Use layman\u2019s terms (e.g., \u201cYour website takes 5 seconds to load, which frustrates customers\u201d instead of \u201cHigh TTFB due to server latency\u201d).\n\n- **Professional Format:**\n  - Use a clean, branded template (e.g., Canva or Adobe PDF templates) with consistent fonts (Arial or Calibri, 11-12pt) and colors matching AI Service Co\u2019s branding.\n  - Include headers/footers with page numbers and company name.\n  - Make it **polished** rather than \u201crough.\u201d Polished reports convey professionalism and trust, especially for local service businesses unfamiliar with digital audits. \u201cRough\u201d designs can appear unprofessional or suspicious.\n\n**Actionable Output:** Create a 4-5 page PDF report for each recipient using the structure above. Save as \u201c[BusinessName]_WebsiteAudit.pdf\u201d (e.g., \u201cSmithPlumbing_WebsiteAudit.pdf\u201d). Use a tool like Canva or Google Docs (exported to PDF) for design.\n\n---\n\n## 3. EMAIL BODY BEST PRACTICES\n**Purpose:** The email body must grab attention, establish credibility, and prompt a response without being flagged as spam.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- **Traffic Light Table:**\n  - Use a simple **HTML table** for the traffic light indicators (\ud83d\udd34 CRITICAL, \ud83d\udfe1 WARNING, \ud83d\udfe2 OPPORTUNITY) to ensure proper rendering across email clients.\n  - Example:\n    ```html\n    <table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"5\">\n      <tr>\n        <th>Area</th>\n        <th>Status</th>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td>Website Speed</td>\n        <td>\ud83d\udd34 CRITICAL</td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td>Mobile Usability</td>\n        <td>\ud83d\udfe1 WARNING</td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td>SEO Basics</td>\n        <td>\ud83d\udfe2 OPPORTUNITY</td>\n      </tr>\n    </table>\n    ```\n  - If HTML is not supported by your email tool, use plain text with emoji symbols (ensure they display correctly in tests).\n\n- **Length:**\n  - Keep the email body **short and punchy** (150-200 words max). Local business owners value brevity.\n  - Structure: Greeting (1 line), intro (2-3 lines), traffic light table, brief mention of attached report/screenshots, call-to-action (1-2 lines).\n\n- **Personalization Elements:**\n  - Address the recipient by name (e.g., \u201cHi John,\u201d) if possible. Use business name if personal name is unavailable (e.g., \u201cHi Smith Plumbing Team,\u201d).\n  - Mention a specific finding tied to their website (e.g., \u201cI noticed your site takes over 5 seconds to load on mobile.\u201d).\n  - Reference their location (e.g., \u201cAs a Lakeland business, your online presence is key to local customers.\u201d).\n\n- **Call-to-Action Placement:**\n  - Place the CTA at the end of the email: \u201cI\u2019d love to discuss how we can improve your website. Reply to this email or call me at [phone number] to schedule a quick chat.\u201d\n  - Optionally, include a secondary CTA mid-email (e.g., \u201cCheck the attached report for details.\u201d).\n\n**Sample Email Body:**\n```\nSubject: Website Issues for [Business Name] \u2013 Let\u2019s Fix Them\n\nHi [Name or Business Name],\n\nI\u2019m Dan with AI Service Co, and I\u2019ve reviewed your website as part of our outreach to Lakeland businesses. I noticed a few areas that could be costing you customers. Here\u2019s a quick summary:\n\n[Insert Traffic Light Table]\n\nI\u2019ve attached a detailed audit report and screenshots of critical issues like slow load times on mobile. These could be hurting your local rankings and customer trust.\n\nI\u2019d love to discuss how we can improve your online presence. Reply to this email or call me at [phone number] to schedule a quick chat.\n\nThanks,\nDan\nAI Service Co\n[Email] | [Phone]\n```\n\n**Actionable Output:** Draft email body using the sample above, insert personalized elements per recipient, and include the HTML traffic light table.\n\n---\n\n## 4. ATTACHMENT STRATEGY\n**Purpose:** Attachments provide value but must be optimized to avoid spam filters and ensure deliverability.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- **Number of Attachments:**\n  - Limit to **4 attachments max** (1 PDF report + 3 screenshots). More than 4 increases the risk of being flagged as spam.\n- **Total File Size:**\n  - Keep total attachment size under **5 MB**. Most email providers flag larger files as suspicious.\n  - Compress PNGs using tools like TinyPNG if needed.\n  - If the PDF exceeds 2 MB, reduce image resolution or use a PDF compressor (e.g., Smallpdf).\n- **Inline Images vs Attachments:**\n  - Avoid inline images in the email body; they often trigger spam filters or fail to load in some clients.\n  - Attach all files (PDF and screenshots) separately with clear, professional file names (e.g., \u201cSmithPlumbing_WebsiteAudit.pdf\u201d, \u201cSmithPlumbing_PageSpeed.png\u201d).\n\n**Actionable Output:** Attach 1 PDF report (under 2 MB) and 3 PNG screenshots (under 1 MB each), totaling under 5 MB per email.\n\n---\n\n## 5. COLD EMAIL COMPLIANCE\n**Purpose:** Ensure compliance with legal standards to avoid penalties and maintain a professional reputation.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- **CAN-SPAM Act Requirements (US Law):**\n  - Include a clear, accurate \u201cFrom\u201d name and email address (e.g., \u201cDan from AI Service Co\u201d <dan@aiserviceco.com>).\n  - Use a truthful subject line (e.g., \u201cWebsite Issues for [Business Name]\u201d \u2013 no deceptive claims like \u201cUrgent Action Required\u201d).\n  - Include a physical mailing address for AI Service Co in the email footer (e.g., \u201cAI Service Co, [Address], Lakeland, FL 33801\u201d).\n  - Provide a way to opt out of future emails (see below).\n- **Unsubscribe Requirements:**\n  - Include an unsubscribe link or clear instructions to opt out (e.g., \u201cIf you\u2019d prefer not to receive future emails, reply with \u2018Unsubscribe\u2019 or click here: [link].\u201d).\n  - Honor opt-out requests within 10 business days.\n  - Note: While CAN-SPAM applies to commercial emails, cold outreach to businesses (B2B) often has fewer restrictions than B2C. Still, include an opt-out to build trust and avoid complaints.\n- **Legal Considerations:**\n  - Avoid making false claims or guarantees (e.g., \u201cWe\u2019ll get you to #1 on Google!\u201d). Focus on observed issues and potential solutions.\n  - Do not harvest email addresses illegally (e.g., scraping without permission). Use verified contact info from public sources like business websites or directories.\n\n**Actionable Output:** Add the following footer to every email:\n```\nAI Service Co\n[Physical Address], Lakeland, FL 33801\nIf you\u2019d prefer not to receive future emails, reply with \u2018Unsubscribe\u2019 or click here: [link to unsubscribe page if available].\n```\n\n---\n\n## SUMMARY OF IMPLEMENTABLE STANDARDS\n1. **Screenshots:** Attach 3 PNG files (PageSpeed Insights, Mobile Homepage View, Lighthouse Performance Audit), each under 1 MB, named descriptively.\n2. **PDF Audit Report:** Create a 4-5 page polished PDF with Cover Page, Executive Summary, Critical Findings, Proposed Solutions, and Next Steps. Save under 2 MB as \u201c[BusinessName]_WebsiteAudit.pdf\u201d.\n3. **Email Body:** Use a short (150-200 words) personalized email with an HTML traffic light table, specific findings, and a clear CTA. Follow the sample provided.\n4. **Attachments:** Limit to 4 files (1 PDF + 3 PNGs), total size under 5 MB, attached separately (not inline).\n5. **Compliance:** Include CAN-SPAM footer with physical address and unsubscribe option. Use truthful subject lines and verified email addresses.\n\nThese standards can be implemented immediately for Dan\u2019s cold outreach campaign to local service businesses in Lakeland, FL. Test the email format with a small batch (5-10 recipients) to ensure deliverability and tweak based on open/reply rates if needed."

Examples:\n    *   \"Quick Website Check-up for [Business Name]\"\n    *   \"[Business Name]:  Are you losing leads online?\"\n    *   \"Website Opportunities for [City] [Service Type]\" (e.g., \"Website Opportunities for Lakeland Plumbing\")\n*   **Personalization:**\n    *   Use the recipient's name and business name.\n    *   Reference their service area (Lakeland, FL).\n    *   Mention a specific service they offer (e.g., \"saw your services for drain cleaning...\").

We help local service businesses in Lakeland, like [Business Name], improve their online presence and get more leads.\n\n    I've run a quick audit of your website and noticed a few areas where improvements could significantly boost your visibility and customer engagement.\n\n    Here's a quick overview:\n\n    [HTML Traffic Light Table - as shown above]\n\n    I've attached a detailed PDF report outlining these findings and potential solutions.

Prioritize optimizing image sizes and compressing the PDF.\n*   **Inline Images vs. Attachments:** Avoid using inline images in cold outreach emails.  Attachments are generally better received by spam filters.\n*   **File Types:** Stick to universally compatible file types like PDF and PNG.\n*   **Attachment Naming:** Use clear and descriptive file names as outlined in previous sections.\n\n**5. COLD EMAIL COMPLIANCE**\n\n**Goal:** Adhere to all applicable laws and regulations to avoid legal issues and maintain sender reputation.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\n*   **CAN-SPAM Requirements:**\n    *   **Accurate Header Information:** Don't use deceptive subject lines or \"From\" addresses.\n    *   **Physical Mailing Address:** Include a valid physical mailing address for AI Service Co. in every email.\n    *   **Clear and Conspicuous Unsubscribe Mechanism:**  Provide a clear and easy-to-find unsubscribe link in every email. This link must work instantly.\n    *   **Honor Opt-Out Requests Promptly:**  Process unsubscribe requests within 10 business days.  Maintain an unsubscribe list.\n*   **Unsubscribe Requirements for Cold Emails:**\n    *   Even for cold outreach, a clear unsubscribe option is mandatory.  Don't assume that since it's unsolicited, unsubscribes aren't required. They are.\n*   **Legal Considerations:**\n    *   **Data Privacy:**  Be mindful of data privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR) when collecting and using email addresses.  Only collect information directly related to the purpose of the outreach.\n    *   **Obtain Consent if Necessary:**  In some jurisdictions, explicit consent may be required for certain types of marketing emails.  Consult with legal counsel to ensure compliance.\n    *   **Domain Authentication:** Set up SPF, DKIM, and DMARC records for your email domain to improve deliverability and prevent email spoofing. This helps establish trust with email providers.\n\n**Disclaimer:** This information is for informational purposes only and does not constitute legal advice. Consult with an attorney to ensure compliance with all applicable laws and regulations.\n"
